<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p>“I hate a Preface!” Such will probably be the reader’s
exclamation on opening this volume. I will, however,
pursue the subject a little further in the form of a dialogue.</p>

<p><i>Author.</i>&mdash;“I entirely agree in your dislike of a Preface;
for a good book needs none, and a dull book cannot
be mended by it.”</p>

<p><i>Reader.</i>&mdash;“If then you coincide in my opinion, why
write a preface? Judging from appearances, your book
is long enough without one!”</p>

<p><i>A.</i>&mdash;“Do not be too severe; it is precisely because
the road which we propose to travel together is of considerable
extent, that I wish to warn you at the outset of
the nature of the scenery, and the entertainment you are
likely to meet with, in order that you may, if these afford
you no attraction, turn aside and seek better amusement
and occupation elsewhere.”</p>

<p><i>R.</i>&mdash;“That seems plausible enough; yet, how can I
be assured that the result will fulfil your promise? I
once travelled in a stage coach, wherein was suspended,
for the benefit of passengers, a coloured print of the
watering&ndash;place which was our destination; it represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
a magnificent hotel, with extensive gardens and shrubberies,
through the shady walks of which, gaily attired
parties were promenading on horseback and on foot.
When we arrived, I found myself at a large, square, unsightly
inn by the sea&ndash;side, where neither flower, shrub,
nor tree was to be seen: and on inquiry, I was informed
that the print represented the hotel as the proprietor
<i>intended it to be</i>! Suppose I were to meet with
a similar disappointment in my journey with you?”</p>

<p><i>A.</i>&mdash;“I can at least offer you this comfort; that
whereas you could not have got out of the stage half&ndash;way
on the road without much inconvenience, you can easily
lay down the book whenever you find it becoming tedious:
if you seek for amusement only, you probably will be
disappointed, because one of my chief aims has been
to afford you correct information respecting the habits,
condition, and character of the North American Indians
and those bordering on their territory. I have introduced
also several incidents founded on actual occurrences; and
some of them, as well as of the characters, are sketched
from personal observation.”</p>

<p><i>R.</i>&mdash;“Indeed! you are then the individual who resided
with the Pawnees, and published, a few years since,
your Travels in North America. I suppose we may expect
in these volumes a sort of <i>pot&ndash;pourri</i>, composed of
all the notes, anecdotes, and observations which you
could not conveniently squeeze into your former book?”</p>

<p><i>A.</i> (<i>looking rather foolish.</i>)&mdash;“Although the terms in
which you have worded your conjecture are not the most
flattering, I own that it is not altogether without foundation;
nevertheless, Gentle Reader&mdash;—“</p>

<p><i>R.</i>&mdash;“Spare your epithets of endearment, or at least
reserve them until I have satisfied myself that I can reply
in a similar strain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A.</i>&mdash;“Nay, it is too churlish to censure a harmless
courtesy that has been adopted even by the greatest dramatists
and novelists from the time of Shakspeare to the
present day.”</p>

<p><i>R.</i>&mdash;“It may be so; permit me, however, to request,
in the words of one of those dramatists to whom you
refer, that you will be so obliging as to</p>

<p class="pph12 p1">‘Forbear the prologue,</p>
<p class="pph6">And let me know the substance of thy tale!’”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A SKETCH OF A VILLAGE IN THE
WEST, AND WILL BE INTRODUCED TO SOME OF THE DRAMATIS
PERSONÆ.</p>

<p class="pn">There is, perhaps, no country in the world more favoured,
in respect to natural advantages, than the state of Ohio in
North America: the soil is of inexhaustible fertility; the climate
temperate; the rivers, flowing into Lake Erie to the north,
and through the Ohio into the Mississippi to the south&ndash;west,
are navigable for many hundreds of miles; the forests abound
with the finest timber, and even the bowels of the earth pay,
in various kinds of mineral, abundant contribution to the
general wealth: the southern frontier of the state is bounded
by the noble river from which she derives her name, and
which obtained from the early French traders and missionaries
the well&ndash;deserved appellation of “La Belle Rivière.”</p>

<p>Towns and cities are now multiplying upon its banks; the
axe has laid low vast tracts of its forest; the plough has passed
over many thousand acres of the prairies which it fertilised;
and crowds of steam&ndash;boats, laden with goods, manufactures,
and passengers, from every part of the world, urge their busy
way through its waters.</p>

<p>Far different was the appearance and condition of that region
at the period when the events detailed in the following narrative
occurred. The reader must bear in mind that, at the close
of the last century, the vast tracts of forest and prairie now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
forming the states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, were all included
in what was then called the North&ndash;west Territory; it
was still inhabited by numerous bands of Indian tribes, of
which the most powerful were the Lenapé, or Delawares, the
Shawanons, the Miamies, and the Wyandotes, or Hurons.</p>

<p>Here and there, at favourable positions on the navigable
rivers, were trading&ndash;posts, defended by small forts, to which the
Indians brought their skins of bear, deer, bison, and beaver;
receiving in exchange powder, rifles, paint, hatchets, knives,
blankets, and other articles, which, although unknown to their
forefathers, had become to them, through their intercourse with
the whites, numbered among the necessaries of life. But the
above&ndash;mentioned animals, especially the two last, were already
scarce in this region; and the more enterprising of the hunters,
Indian as well as white men, made annual excursions to the wild
and boundless hunting&ndash;ground, westward of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>At the close of the eighteenth century, the villages and settlements
on the north bank of the Ohio, being scarce and far
apart, were built rather for the purpose of trading with the
Indians than for agriculture or civilised industry; and their
inhabitants were as bold and hardy, sometimes as wild and
lawless, as the red men, with whom they were beginning to
dispute the soil.</p>

<p>Numerous quarrels arose between these western settlers and
their Indian neighbours; blood was frequently shed, and fierce
retaliation ensued, which ended in open hostility. The half&ndash;disciplined
militia, aided sometimes by regular troops, invaded
and burnt the Indian villages; while the red men, seldom able
to cope with their enemy in the open field, cut off detached
parties, massacred unprotected families; and so swift and indiscriminate
was their revenge, that settlements, at some distance
from the scene of war, were often aroused at midnight by the
unexpected alarm of the war&ndash;whoop and the fire&ndash;brand. There
were occasions, however, when the Indians boldly attacked and
defeated the troops sent against them; but General Wayne,
having taken the command of the western forces (about four
years before the commencement of our tale), routed them at the
battle of the Miamies with great slaughter; after which many
of them went off to the Missain plains, and those who remained
no more ventured to appear in the field against the
United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the earliest trading ports established in that region
was Marietta, a pretty village situated at the mouth of the
Muskimgum river, where it falls into the Ohio. Even so far
back as the year 1799 it boasted a church; several taverns; a
strong block&ndash;house, serving as a protection against an attack
from the Indians; stores for the sale of grocery; and, in
short, such a collection of buildings as has, in more than one
instance in the western states of America, grown into a city
with unexampled rapidity.</p>

<p>This busy and flourishing village had taken the lead, of all
others within a hundred miles, in the construction of vessels
for the navigation of the Ohio and Mississippi; nay, some of
the more enterprising merchants there settled, had actually
built, launched, and freighted brigs and schooners of sufficient
burthen to brave the seas of the Mexican gulf; and had
opened, in their little inland port, a direct trade with the West
Indian islands, to which they exported flour, pork, maize, and
other articles, their vessels returning laden with fruit, coffee,
sugar, and rum.</p>

<p>The largest store in the village, situated in the centre of a
row of houses fronting the river, was built of brick, and
divided into several compartments, wherein were to be found
all the necessaries of life,—all such at least as were called
for by the inhabitants of Marietta and its neighbourhood; one
of these compartments was crowded with skins and furs from
the north&ndash;west, and with clothes, cottons, and woollen stuffs
from England; the second with earthenware, cutlery, mirrors,
rifles, stoves, grates, &amp;c.; while in the third, which was certainly
the most frequented, were sold flour, tea, sugar, rum, whiskey,
gunpowder, spices, cured pork, &amp;c.; in a deep corner or recess
of the latter was a trap&ndash;door, not very often opened, but which
led to a cellar, wherein was stored a reasonable quantity of
Madeira and claret, the quality of which would not have disgraced
the best hotel in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Over this multifarious property on sale presided David
Muir, a bony, long&ndash;armed man, of about forty&ndash;five years of
age, whose red bristly hair, prominent cheek bones, and sharp,
sunken grey eyes, would, without the confirming evidence of
his broad Scottish accent, have indicated to an experienced
observer the country to which he owed his birth. In the
duties of his employment, David was well seconded by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
helpmate, a tall, powerful woman, whose features, though
strong and masculine, retained the marks of early beauty, and
whose voice, when raised in wrath, reached the ears of every
individual, even in the furthest compartment of the extensive
store above described.</p>

<p>David was a shrewd, enterprising fellow, trustworthy in
matters of business, and peaceable enough in temper; though
in more than one affray, which had arisen in consequence of
some of his customers, white men and Indians, having taken
on the spot too much of his “fire&ndash;water,” he had shown that
he was not to be affronted with impunity; nevertheless, in
the presence of Mrs. Christie (so was his spouse called) he
was gentle and subdued, never attempting to rebel against an
authority which an experience of twenty years had proved to
be irresistible. One only child, aged now about eighteen, was
the fruit of their marriage; and Jessie Muir was certainly
more pleasing in her manners and in her appearance than
might have been expected from her parentage; she assisted
her mother in cooking, baking, and other domestic duties;
and, when not thus engaged, read or worked in a corner of the
cotton and silk compartment, over which she presided. Two
lads, engaged at a salary of four dollars a&ndash;week, to assist in the
sale, care, and package of the goods, completed David’s establishment,
which was perhaps the largest and the best provided
that could be found westward of the Alleghany mountains.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that all this property
was his own: it belonged for the most part to Colonel Brandon,
a gentleman who resided on his farm, seven or eight miles
from the village, and who entrusted David Muir with the
entire charge of the stores in Marietta; the accounts of the
business were regularly audited by the colonel once every year,
and a fair share of the profits as regularly made over to David,
whose accuracy and integrity had given much satisfaction to
his principal.</p>

<p>Three of the largest trading vessels from the port of Marietta
were owned and freighted by Colonel Brandon; the command
and management of them being entrusted by him to
Edward Ethelston, a young man who, being now in his twenty&ndash;eighth
year, discharged the duties of captain and supercargo
with the greatest steadiness, ability, and success.</p>

<p>As young Ethelston and his family will occupy a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
place in our narrative, it may be as well to detail
briefly the circumstances which led to his enjoying so large a
share of the Colonel’s affection and confidence.</p>

<p>About eleven years before the date mentioned as being that
of the commencement of our tale, Colonel Brandon, having
sold his property in Virginia, had moved to the north&ndash;west
territory, with his wife and his two children, Reginald and
Lucy. He had persuaded, at the same time, a Virginian friend,
Digby Ethelston, who, like himself, was descended from an
ancient royalist family in the mother country, to accompany
him in this migration. The feelings, associations, and prejudices
of both the friends had been frequently wounded during the
war which terminated in the independence of the United States;
for not only were both attached by those feelings and associations
to the old country, but they had also near connections resident
there, with whom they kept up a friendly intercourse.</p>

<p>It was not, therefore, difficult for Colonel Brandon to persuade
his friend to join him in his proposed emigration. The
latter, who was a widower, and who, like the colonel, had only
two children, was fortunate in having under his roof a sister,
who, being now past the prime of life, devoted herself entirely
to the charge of her brother’s household. Aunt Mary (for she
was known by no other name) expressed neither aversion nor
alarm at the prospect of settling permanently in so remote a
region; and the two families moved accordingly, with goods
and chattels, to the banks of the Ohio.</p>

<p>The Colonel and his friend were both possessed of considerable
property, a portion of which they invested in the fur
companies, which at that time carried on extensive traffic
in the north&ndash;west territory; they also acquired from the United
States government large tracts of land at no great distance
from Marietta, upon which each selected an agreeable site for
his farm or country residence.</p>

<p>Their houses were not far apart, and though rudely built at
first, they gradually assumed a more comfortable appearance;
wings were added, stables enlarged, the gardens and peach&ndash;orchards
were well fenced, and the adjoining farm&ndash;offices
amply stocked with horses and cattle.</p>

<p>For two years all went on prosperously: the boys, Edward
Ethelston and Reginald Brandon, were as fond of each other
as their fathers could desire: the former, being three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the senior, and possessed of excellent qualities of head and
heart, controlled the ardent and somewhat romantic temper of
Reginald: both were at school near Philadelphia: when on a
beautiful day in June, Mr. Ethelston and Aunt Mary walked
over to pay a visit to Mrs. Brandon, leaving little Evelyn
(who was then about eight years old) with her nurse at home:
they remained at Colonel Brandon’s to dine, and were on the
point of returning in the afternoon, when a farm&ndash;servant of
Mr. Ethelston’s rushed into the room where the two gentlemen
were sitting alone; he was pale, breathless, and so agitated
that he could not utter a syllable: “For heaven’s sake speak!
What has happened?” exclaimed Colonel Brandon.</p>

<p>A dreadful pause ensued: at length, he rather gasped than
<i>said</i>, “The Indians!” and buried his face in his hands, as if
to shut out some horrid spectacle!</p>

<p>Poor Ethelston’s tongue clove to his mouth; the prescient
agony of a father overcame him.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> of the Indians, man?” said Colonel Brandon,
angrily; “‘sblood, we have seen Indians enough hereabout
before now;—what the devil have they been at?”</p>

<p>A groan and a shudder was the only reply.</p>

<p>The Colonel now lost all patience, and exclaimed, “By heavens,
the sight of a red&ndash;skin seems to have frightened the
fellow out of his senses! I did not know, Ethelston, that you
trusted your farm&ndash;stock to such a chicken&ndash;heart as this!”</p>

<p>Incensed by this taunt, the rough lad replied, “Colonel
for all as you be so bold, and have seen, as they say, a bloody
field or two, you’d a’ been skeared if you’d a’ seen <i>this</i> job;
but as for my being afeared of Ingians in an up and down
fight, or in a tree skrimmage—I don’t care who says it—t’aint
a fact.”</p>

<p>“I believe it, my good fellow,” said the Colonel; “but
keep us no longer in suspense—say what has happened?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, Colonel, about an hour ago, Jem and
Eliab was at work in the ‘baccy&ndash;field behind the house, and
nurse was out in the big meadow a walkin’ with Miss Evelyn,
when I heard a cry as if all the devils had broke loose; in a
moment, six or eight painted Ingians with rifles and tomahawks
dashed out of the laurel thicket, and murdered poor
Jem and Eliab before they could get at their rifles which stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
by the <i>worm</i> fence<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; two of them then went after the nurse
and child in the meadow, while the rest broke into the house,
which they ransacked and set o’ fire!”</p>

<p>“But my child?” cried the agonised father.</p>

<p>“I fear it’s gone too,” said the messenger of this dreadful
news. “I saw one devil kill and scalp the nurse, and t’other,”—here
he paused, awe&ndash;struck by the speechless agony of poor
Ethelston, who stood with clasped hands and bloodless lips,
unable to ask for the few more words which were to complete
his despair.</p>

<p>“Speak on, man, let us know the worst;” said the Colonel,
at the same time supporting the trembling form of his unhappy
friend.</p>

<p>“I seed the tomahawk raised over the sweet child, and I
tried to rush out o’ my hidin’ place to save it, when the flames
and the smoke broke out, and I tumbled into the big ditch
below the garden, over head in water; by the time I got out
and reached the place, the red devils were all gone, and the
house, and straw, and barns all in a blaze!”</p>

<p>Poor Ethelston had only heard the first few words—they
were enough—his head sunk upon his breast, his whole frame
shuddered convulsively; and a rapid succession of inarticulate
sounds came from his lips, among which nothing could be distinguished
beyond “child,” “tomahawk,” “Evelyn.”</p>

<p>It is needless to relate in detail all that followed this painful
scene; the bodies of the unfortunate labourers and of the
nurse were found; all had been scalped; that of the child
was not found; and though Colonel Brandon himself led a
band of the most experienced hunters in pursuit, the trail of
the savages could not be followed: with their usual wily foresight
they had struck off through the forest in different directions,
and succeeded in baffling all attempts at discovering
either their route or their tribe. Messengers were sent to the
trading&ndash;posts at Kaskaskia, Vincennes, and even to Genevieve,
and St. Louis, and all returned dispirited by a laborious and
fruitless search.</p>

<p>Mr. Ethelston never recovered this calamitous blow: several
fits of paralysis, following each other in rapid succession, carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
him off within a few months. By his will he appointed
a liberal annuity to Aunt Mary, and left the remainder of his
property to his son Edward, but entirely under the control and
guardianship of Colonel Brandon.</p>

<p>The latter had prevailed upon Aunt Mary and her young
nephew to become inmates of his house; where, after the soothing
effect of time had softened the bitterness of their grief,
they found the comforts, the occupations, the endearments, the
social blessings embodied in the word “home.” Edward became
more fondly attached than ever to his younger companion
Reginald; and Aunt Mary, besides aiding Mrs. Brandon
in the education of her daughter, found time to knit, to
hem, to cook, to draw, to plant vegetables, to rear flowers, to
read, to give medicine to any sick in the neighbourhood, and
to comfort all who, like herself, had suffered under the chastising
hand of Providence.</p>

<p>Such were the circumstances which (eleven years before the
commencement of this narrative) had led to the affectionate
and paternal interest which the Colonel felt for the son of his
friend, and which was increased by the high and estimable
qualities gradually developed in Edward’s character. Before
proceeding further in our tale, it is necessary to give the reader
some insight into the early history of Colonel Brandon himself,
and into those occurrences in the life of his son Reginald
which throw light upon the events hereafter to be related.</p>

<h2 class="pc2">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE MARRIAGE OF COLONEL BRANDON,
AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</p>

<p class="pn">George Brandon was the only son of a younger brother, a
scion of an ancient and distinguished family: they had been,
for the most part, staunch Jacobites, and George’s father lost
the greater part of his property in a fruitless endeavour to
support the ill&ndash;timed and ill&ndash;conducted expedition of Charles
Edward, in 1745.</p>

<p>After this he retired to the Continent and died, leaving to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
his son little else besides his sword, a few hundred crowns, and
an untarnished name. The young man returned to England;
and, being agreeable, accomplished, and strikingly handsome,
was kindly received by some of his relations and their friends.</p>

<p>During one of the visits that he paid at the house of a
neighbour in the country, he fell desperately in love with Lucy
Shirley, the daughter of the richest squire in the country, a
determined Whig, and one who hated a Jacobite worse than a
Frenchman. As George Brandon’s passion was returned with
equal ardour, and the object of it was young and inexperienced
as himself, all the obstacles opposed to their union only
served to add fuel to the flame; and, after repeated but vain
endeavours on the part of Lucy Shirley to reconcile her father,
or her only brother, to the match, she eloped with her young
lover; and, by a rapid escape into Scotland, where they were
immediately married, they rendered abortive all attempt at
pursuit.</p>

<p>It was not long before the young couple began to feel some
of the painful consequences of their imprudence. The old
squire was not to be appeased; he would neither see his
daughter, nor would he open one of the many letters which
she wrote to entreat his forgiveness: but, although incensed,
he was a proud man and scrupulously just in all his dealings:
Lucy had been left 10,000<i>l.</i> by her grand&ndash;mother, but it was
not due to her until she attained her twenty&ndash;first year, or
<i>married with her father’s consent</i>. The squire waved both
these conditions; he knew that his daughter had fallen from
a brilliant sphere to one comparatively humble. Even in
the midst of his wrath he did not wish her to starve, and
accordingly instructed his lawyer to write to Mrs. Brandon,
and to inform her that he had orders to pay her 500<i>l.</i> a&ndash;year,
until she thought fit to demand the payment of the principal.</p>

<p>George and his wife returned, after a brief absence, to
England, and made frequent efforts to overcome, by entreaty
and submission, the old squire’s obduracy; but it was all in
vain: neither were they more successful in propitiating the
young squire, an eccentric youth, who lived among dogs and
horses, and who had imbibed from his father an hereditary
taste for old port, and an antipathy to Jacobites. His reply
to a letter which George wrote, entreating his good offices in
effecting a reconciliation between Lucy and her father, will serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
better than an elaborate description to illustrate his character;
it ran as follows:—</p>

<p class="pbqh p1">“Sir,</p>

<p class="pbq">“When my sister married a Jacobite, against Father’s
consent, she carried her eggs to a fool’s market, and she must
make the best of her own bargain. Father isn’t such a flat
as to be gulled with your fine words now: and tho’ they say
I’m not over forw’rd in my schoolin’, you must put some
better bait on your trap before you catch</p>

<p class="pbqr">
“<span class="smcap">Marmaduke Shirley</span>, Jun.”<br />
</p>

<p class="p1">It may well be imagined, that after the receipt of this
epistle George Brandon did not seek to renew his intercourse
with Lucy’s brother: but as she had now presented him with
a little boy, he began to meditate seriously on the means which
he should adopt to better his fortunes.</p>

<p>One of his most intimate and esteemed friends, Digby
Ethelston, being, like himself, a portionless member of an
ancient family, had gone out early in life to America, and
had, by dint of persevering industry, gained a respectable
competence: while in the southern colonies he had married the
daughter of an old French planter, who had left the marquisate
to which he was entitled in his own country, in order to live in
peace and quiet among the sugar&ndash;canes and cotton&ndash;fields of
Louisiana. Ethelston had received with his wife a considerable
accession of fortune, and they were on the eve of returning
across the Atlantic, her husband having settled all the affairs
which had brought him to England.</p>

<p>His representations of the New World made a strong impression
on the sanguine mind of George Brandon, and he
proposed to his wife to emigrate with their little one to America.
Poor Lucy, cut off from her own family, and devoted to
her husband, made no difficulty whatever, and it was soon
settled that they should accompany the Ethelstons.</p>

<p>George now called upon Mr. Shirley’s solicitor, a dry,
matter&ndash;of&ndash;fact, parchment man, to inform him of their intention,
and of their wish that the principal of Lucy’s fortune
might be paid up. The lawyer took down a dusty box of
black tin whereon was engraved “Marmaduke Shirley, Esq.,
Shirley Hall, No. 7.”; and after carefully perusing a paper of
instructions, he said, “Mrs. Brandon’s legacy shall be paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
up, sir, on the 1st of July, to any party whom she may empower
to receive it on her behalf, and to give a legal discharge
for the same.”</p>

<p>“And pray, sir,” said George, hesitating, “as we are
going across the Atlantic, perhaps never to return, do you
not think Mr. Shirley would see his daughter once before she
sails, to give her his blessing?”</p>

<p>Again the man of parchment turned his sharp nose towards
the paper, and having scanned its contents, he said, “I find
nothing, sir, in these instructions on that point. Good morning,
Mr. Brandon.—James, show in Sir John Waltham.”</p>

<p>George walked home dispirited, and the punctual solicitor
failed not to inform the squire immediately of the young
couple’s intended emigration, and the demand for the paying
up of the sum due to Lucy. In spite of his long&ndash;cherished
prejudices against George Brandon’s Jacobite family, and his
anger at the elopement, he was somewhat softened by time, by
what he heard of the blameless life led by the young man,
and by the respectful conduct that the latter had evinced towards
his wife’s family; for it had happened on one occasion
that some of his young companions had thought fit to speak
of the obstinacy and stinginess of the old squire: this language
George had instantly and indignantly checked, saying,
“My conduct in marrying his daughter against his consent,
was unjustifiable: though he has not forgiven her, has he behaved
justly and honourably. Any word spoken disrespectfully
of my wife’s father, I shall consider a personal insult to
myself.”</p>

<p>This had accidentally reached the ears of the old squire; and
though still too proud and too obstinate to agree to any reconciliation,
he said to the solicitor: “Perkins, I will not be reconciled
to these scapegraces; I will have no intercourse with
them, but I will <i>see</i> Lucy before she goes; she must not see
me. Arrange it as you please: desire her to come to your
house to sign the discharge for the 10,000<i>l.</i>, in person; you
can put me in a cupboard, in the next room; where you will;
a glass door will do;—you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. When?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the sooner the better; whenever the papers are
ready.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done, sir.” And thus the interview closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime George made one final effort in a letter, which he
addressed to the squire, couched in terms at once manly and respectful;
owning the errors that he had committed, but hoping
that forgiveness might precede this long, this last separation.</p>

<p>This letter was returned to him unopened; and, in order
to conceal from Lucy the grief and mortification of his high
and wounded spirit, he was obliged to absent himself from
home for many hours; and when he did return, it was with a
clouded brow.</p>

<p>Certainly the fate of this young couple, though not altogether
prosperous, was in one particular a remarkable exception
to the usual results of a runaway match; they were affectionately
and entirely devoted to each other: and Lucy, though
she had been once, and only once, a disobedient daughter,
was the most loving and obedient of wives.</p>

<p>The day fixed for her signature arrived. Mr. Perkins had
made all his arrangements agreeably to his wealthy client’s instructions;
and when, accompanied by her husband, she entered
the solicitor’s study, she was little conscious that her
father was separated from her only by a frail door, which being
left ajar, he could see her, and hear every word that she spoke.</p>

<p>Mr. Perkins, placing the draft of the discharge into George
Brandon’s hand, together with the instrument whereby his
wife was put in possession of the 10,000<i>l.</i>, said to him,
“Would it not be better, sir, to send for your solicitor to inspect
these papers on behalf of yourself and Mrs. Brandon,
before she signs the discharge?”</p>

<p>“Allow me to inquire, sir,” replied George, “whether Mr.
Shirley has perused these papers, and has placed them here
for his daughter’s signature?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly, he has, sir,” said the lawyer, “and I have
too, on his behalf; you do not imagine, sir, that my client
would pay the capital sum without being certain that the discharge
was regular and sufficient!”</p>

<p>“Then I am satisfied, sir,” said George, with something of
disdain expressed on his fine countenance. “Mr. Shirley is a
man of honour, and a father; whatever he has sent for his
daughter’s signature will secure her interests as effectually as
if a dozen solicitors had inspected it.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this speech, a sort of indistinct <i>hem</i>
proceeded from the ensconced squire; to cover which, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Perkins said, “But, sir, it is not usual to sign papers of this
consequence without examining them.”</p>

<p>“Lucy, my dear,” said George, turning with a smile of
affectionate confidence to his wife; “to oblige Mr. Perkins, I
will read through these two papers attentively: sit down for
a minute, as they are somewhat long:” so saying, he applied
himself at once to his task.</p>

<p>Meantime Lucy, painfully agitated and excited, made several
attempts to address Mr. Perkins; but her voice failed
her, as soon as she turned her eyes upon that gentleman’s
rigid countenance: at length, however, by a desperate effort,
she succeeded in asking, tremulously, “Mr. Perkins, have you
seen my father lately?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said the lawyer nibbing his pen.</p>

<p>“Oh! tell me how he is!—Has the gout left him?—Can
he ride to the farm as he used?”</p>

<p>“He is well, madam, very well, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Shall you see him soon again, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam, I must show him these papers, when
signed.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then, tell him, that his daughter, who never disobeyed
him but once, has wept bitterly for her fault; that she
will probably never see him again, in this world; that she
blesses him in her daily prayers. Oh! tell him, I charge you
as you are a man, tell him, that I could cross the ocean
happy—that I could bear years of sickness, of privation,
happy—that I could die happy, if I had but my dear, dear
father’s blessing.” As she said this, the young wife had
unconsciously fallen upon one knee before the man of law,
and her tearful eyes were bent upon his countenance in earnest
supplication.</p>

<p>Again an indistinct noise, as of a suppressed groan or sob,
was heard from behind the door, and the solicitor wiping his
spectacles and turning away his face to conceal an emotion of
which he felt rather ashamed, said: “I will tell him all you
desire, madam; and if I receive his instructions to make any
communication in reply, I will make it faithfully, and without
loss of time.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you a thousand times,” said Lucy:
and resuming her seat, she endeavoured to recover her composure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>George had by this time run his eye over the papers; and
although he had overheard his wife’s appeal to the solicitor, he
would not interrupt her, nor throw any obstacle in the way of
an object which he knew she had so much at heart. “I am
perfectly satisfied, sir,” said he; “you have nothing to do
but to provide the witnesses, and Mrs. Brandon will affix her
signature.”</p>

<p>Two clerks of Mr. Perkins’ were accordingly summoned,
and the discharge having been signed in their presence, they
retired. Mr. Perkins now drew another paper from the leaves
of a book on his table, saying: “Mr. Brandon, the discharge
being now signed and attested, I have further instructions from
Mr. Shirley to inform you, that although he cannot alter his
determination of refusing to see his daughter, or holding any
intercourse with yourself, he is desirous that you should not in
America find yourself in straitened circumstances; and has
accordingly authorised me to place in your hands this draft
upon his banker for 5000<i>l.</i>”</p>

<p>“Mr. Perkins,” said George, in a tone of mingled sadness
and pride; “in the payment of the 10,000<i>l.</i>, my wife’s fortune,
Mr. Shirley, though acting honourably, has only done
justice, and has dealt as he would have dealt with strangers;
had he thought proper to listen to my wife’s, or to my own repeated
entreaties for forgiveness and reconciliation, I would
gratefully have received from him, as from a father, any favour
that he wished to confer on us; but, sir, as he refuses to see
me under his roof, or even to give his affectionate and repentant
child a parting blessing, I would rather work for my
daily bread than receive at his hands the donation of a
guinea.”</p>

<p>As he said this, he tore the draft and scattered its shreds on
the table before the astonished lawyer. Poor Lucy was still
in tears, yet one look assured her husband that she <i>felt</i> with
him. He added in a gentler tone, “Mr. Perkins, accept my
acknowledgments for your courtesy;” and, offering his arm to
Lucy, turned to leave the room.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">CONTAINING SOME FURTHER ACCOUNT OF COLONEL AND MRS. BRANDON,
AND OF THE EDUCATION OF THEIR SON REGINALD.</p>

<p class="pn">While the scene described in the last chapter was passing in
the lawyer’s study, stormy and severe was the struggle going
on in the breast of the listening father; more than once he
had been on the point of rushing into the room to fold his
child in his arms; but that obstinate pride, which causes in
life so many bitter hours of regret, prevented him, and checked
the natural impulse of affection: still, as she turned with her
husband to leave the room, he unconsciously opened the door
on the lock of which his hand rested, as he endeavoured to
get one last look at a face which he had so long loved and
caressed. The door being thus partially opened, a very diminutive
and favourite spaniel, that accompanied him wherever he
went, escaped through the aperture, and, recognising Lucy,
barked and jumped upon her in an ecstasy of delight.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” cried she, “it is—it must be Fan!” At
another time she would have fondly caressed it, but one only
thought now occupied her: trembling on her husband’s arm,
she whispered, “George, papa <i>must</i> be here.” At that moment
her eye caught the partially opened door, which the
agitated squire still held, and breaking from her husband, she
flew as if by instinct into the adjacent room, and fell at her
father’s feet.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Perkins was now grievously disconcerted; and
calling out, “This way, madam, this way; that is not the
right door,” was about to follow, when George Brandon, laying
his hand upon the lawyer’s arm, said, impressively,</p>

<p>“Stay, sir; that room is sacred!” and led him back to his
chair. His quick mind had seized in a moment the correctness
of Lucy’s conjecture, and his good feeling taught him
that no third person, not even he, should intrude upon the
father and the child.</p>

<p>The old squire could not make a long resistance when the
gush of his once loved Lucy’s tears trickled upon his hand,
and while her half&ndash;choked voice sobbed for his pardon and his
blessing; it was in vain that he summoned all his pride, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
his strength, all his anger; Nature would assert her rights;
and in another minute his child’s head was on his bosom, and
he whispered over her, “I forgive you, Lucy: may God bless
you, as I do!”</p>

<p>For some time after this was the interview prolonged, and
Lucy seemed to be pleading for some boon which she could
not obtain; nevertheless, her tears, her old familiar childish
caresses, had regained something of their former dominion
over the choleric but warm&ndash;hearted squire; and in a voice of
joy that thrilled even through the quiet man of law, she cried,
“George! George, come in!” He leaped from his seat, and
in a moment was at the feet of her father. There, as he
knelt by Lucy’s side, the old squire put one hand upon the
head of each, saying, “My children, all that you have ever
done to offend me is forgotten: continue to love and to cherish
each other, and may God prosper you with every blessing!”
George Brandon’s heart was full: he could not speak; but
straining his wife affectionately to his bosom, and kissing her
father’s hand, he withdrew into a corner of the room, and for
some minutes remained oppressed by emotions too strong to
find relief in expressions.</p>

<p>We need not detail at length the consequences of this happy
and unexpected reconciliation. The check was re&ndash;written,
was doubled, and was accepted. George still persevered in his
wish to accompany his friend to Virginia; where, Ethelston
assured him, that with his 20,000<i>l.</i> prudently managed, he
might easily acquire a sufficient fortune for himself and his
family.</p>

<p>How mighty is the power of circumstance; and upon what
small pivots does Providence sometimes allow the wheels of
human fortune to be turned! Here, in the instance just related,
the blessing or unappeased wrath of a father, the joy or
despair of a daughter, the peace or discord of a family, all,
all were dependent upon the bark and caress of a spaniel! For
that stern old man had made his determination, and would
have adhered to it, if Lucy had not thus been made aware of
his presence, and, by her grief aiding the voice of nature, overthrown
all the defences of his pride.</p>

<p>It happened that the young squire was at this time in Paris,
his father having sent him thither to see the world and learn
to fence. A letter was, however, written by Lucy, announcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to him the happy reconciliation, and entreating him to participate
in their common happiness.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the voyage were soon completed; the
cabin of a large vessel being engaged to convey the whole party
to Norfolk in Virginia. The old squire offered no opposition,
considering that George Brandon was too old to begin a profession
in England, and that he might employ his time and
abilities advantageously in the New World.</p>

<p>We may pass over many of the ensuing years, the events of
which have little influence on our narrative, merely informing
the reader that the investment of Brandon’s money, made by
the advice of Ethelston, was prosperous in the extreme. In
the course of a year or two, Mrs. Brandon presented her lord
with a little girl, who was named after herself. In the following
year, Mrs. Ethelston had also a daughter: the third
confinement was not so fortunate, and she died in childbed,
leaving, to Ethelston, Edward, then about nine, and little
Evelyn a twelvemonth old.</p>

<p>It was on this sad occasion that he persuaded his sister to
come out from England to reside with him, and take care of
his motherless children: a task that she undertook and fulfilled
with the love and devotion of the most affectionate mother.</p>

<p>In course of time the war broke out which ended in the
independence of the colonies. During its commencement,
Brandon and Ethelston both remained firm to the crown; but
as it advanced, they became gradually convinced of the impolicy
and injustice of the claims urged by England. Brandon
having sought an interview with Washington, the arguments,
and the character, of that great man decided him: he joined
the Independent party, obtained a command, and distinguished
himself so much as to obtain the esteem and regard of his
commander. As soon as peace was established, he had, for
reasons before stated, determined to change his residence, and
persuaded Ethelston to accompany him with his family.</p>

<p>After the dreadful domestic calamity mentioned in the first
chapter, and the untimely death of Ethelston, Colonel Brandon
sent Edward, the son of his deceased friend, to a distant relative
in Hamburgh, desiring that every care might be given to
give him a complete mercantile and liberal education, including
two years’ study at a German university.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old Squire Shirley was dead; but his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and successor had written, after his own strange fashion, a
letter to his sister, begging her to send over her boy to England,
and he would “make a man of him.” After duly
weighing this proposal, Colonel and Mrs. Brandon determined
to avail themselves of it; and Reginald was accordingly sent
over to his uncle, who had promised to enter him immediately
at Oxford.</p>

<p>When Reginald arrived, Marmaduke Shirley turned him
round half a dozen times, felt his arms, punched his ribs,
looked at his ruddy cheeks and brown hair, that had never
known a barber, and exclaimed to a brother sportsman who
was standing by, “D—n if he ain’t one of the right sort!
eh, Harry?” But if the uncle was pleased with the lad’s
appearance, much more delighted was he with his accomplishments:
for he could <i>walk down</i> any keeper on the estate, he
sat on a horse like a young centaur, and his accuracy with a
rifle perfectly confounded the squire. “If this isn’t a chip
of the old block, my name isn’t Marmaduke Shirley,” said
he; and for a moment a shade crossed his usually careless
brow, as he remembered that he had wooed, and married, and
been left a childless widower.</p>

<p>But although, at Shirley Hall, Reginald followed the sports
of the field with the ardour natural to his age and character,
he rather annoyed the squire by his obstinate and persevering
attention to his studies at college: he remembered that walking
and shooting were accomplishments which he might have
acquired and perfected in the woods of Virginia; but he felt
it due to his parents, and to the confidence which they had
reposed in his discretion, to carry back with him some more
useful knowledge and learning.</p>

<p>With this dutiful motive, he commenced his studies; and
as he advanced in them, his naturally quick intellect seized on
and appreciated the beauties presented to it. Authors, in whose
writings he had imagined and expected little else but difficulties,
soon became easy and familiar; and what he had imposed
upon himself from a high principle as a task, proved,
ere long, a source of abundant pleasure.</p>

<p>In the vacations he visited his good&ndash;humoured uncle, who
never failed to rally him as a “Latin&ndash;monger” and a book&ndash;worm:
but Reginald bore the jokes with temper not less
merry than his uncle’s; and whenever, after a hard run, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
had “pounded” the squire or the huntsman, he never failed
to retaliate by answering the compliments paid him on his
riding with some such jest as, “Pretty well for a book&ndash;worm,
uncle.” It soon became evident to all the tenants, servants,
and indeed to the whole neighbourhood, that Reginald exercised
a despotic influence over the squire, who respected internally
those literary attainments in his nephew which he
affected to ridicule.</p>

<p>When Reginald had taken his degree, which he did with
high honour and credit, he felt an ardent desire to visit his
friend and school&ndash;fellow, Edward Ethelston, in Germany: he
was also anxious to see something of the Continent, and to
study the foreign languages. This wish he expressed without
circumlocution to the squire, who received the communication
with undisguised disapprobation: “What the devil can the
boy want to go abroad for? not satisfied with wasting two or
three years poking over Greek, Latin, mathematics, and other
infernal ‘atics’ and ‘ologies,’ now you must go across the
Channel to eat sour&ndash;krout, soup&ndash;maigre, and frogs! I won’t
hear of it, sir;” and in order to keep his wrath warm, the
squire poked the fire violently.</p>

<p>In spite of this determination, Reginald, as usual, carried
his point, and in a few weeks was on board a packet bound
for Hamburgh, his purse being well filled by the squire, who
told him to see all that could be seen, and “not to let any
of those Mounseers top him at any thing.” Reginald was
also provided with letters of credit to a much larger amount
than he required; but the first hint which he gave of a wish
to decline a portion of the squire’s generosity raised such a
storm, that our hero was fain to submit.</p>

<p class="pch">CONTAINING SUNDRY ADVENTURES OF REGINALD BRANDON AND HIS
FRIEND ETHELSTON ON THE CONTINENT; ALSO SOME FURTHER
PROCEEDINGS AT SQUIRE SHIRLEY’S; AND THE RETURN OF REGINALD
BRANDON TO HIS HOME.—IN THIS CHAPTER THE SPORTING
READER WILL FIND AN EXAMPLE OF AN UNMADE RIDER ON A
MADE HUNTER.</p>

<p class="pn">Reginald having joined his attached and faithful friend
Ethelston at Hamburgh, the young men agreed to travel
together; and the intimacy of their early boyhood ripened
into a mature friendship, based upon mutual esteem. In personal
advantages, Reginald was greatly the superior; for
although unusually tall and strongly built, such was the perfect
symmetry of his proportions, that his height, and the great
muscular strength of his chest and limbs, were carried off by
the grace with which he moved, and by the air of high breeding
by which he was distinguished: his countenance was
noble and open in expression; and though there was a fire in
his dark eye which betokened passions easily aroused, still
there was a frankness on the brow, and a smile around the
mouth, that told of a nature at once kindly, fearless, and
without suspicion.</p>

<p>Ethelston, who was, be it remembered, three years older than
his friend, was of middle stature, but active, and well proportioned:
his hair and eyebrows were of the jettest black, and
his countenance thoughtful and grave; but there was about the
full and firm lip an expression of determination not to be mistaken.
Habits of study and reflection had already written their
trace upon his high and intellectual brow; so that one who
saw him for the first time might imagine him only a severe
student; but ere he had seen him an hour in society, he would
pronounce him a man of practical and commanding character.
The shade of melancholy, which was almost habitual on his
countenance, dated from the death of his father, brought prematurely
by sorrow to his grave, and from the loss of his
little sister, to whom he had been tenderly attached. The two
friends loved each other with the affection of brothers; and
after the separation of the last few years, each found in the
other newly developed qualities to esteem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The state of Europe during the autumn of 1795 not being
favourable for distant excursions, Ethelston contented himself
with showing his friend all objects worthy of his attention in
the north of Germany, and at the same time assisted him in
attaining its rich though difficult language. By associating
much, during the winter, with the students from the universities,
Reginald caught some of their enthusiasm respecting the
defence of their country from the arms of the French republic:
he learnt that a large number of Ethelston’s acquaintances at
Hamburgh had resolved in the spring to join a corps of volunteers
from the Hanseatic towns, destined to fight under the
banner of the Archduke Charles: to their own surprise, our
two friends were carried away by the stream, and found themselves
enrolled in a small but active and gallant band of sharpshooters,
ordered to act on the flank of a large body of Austrian
infantry. More than once the impetuous courage of
Reginald had nearly cost him his life; and in the action at
Amberg, where the Archduke defeated General Bernadotte, he
received two wounds, such as would have disabled a man of
less hardy constitution. It was in vain that Ethelston, whose
bravery was tempered by unruffled coolness, urged his friend
to expose himself less wantonly; Reginald always promised it,
but in the excitement of the action always forgot the promise.</p>

<p>After he had recovered from his wounds, his commanding
officer, who had noticed his fearless daring, a quality so valuable
in the skirmishing duty to which his corps were
appointed, sent for him, and offered to promote him. “Sir,”
said Reginald, modestly, “I thank you heartily, but I must
decline the honour you propose to me. I am too inexperienced
to lead others; my friend and comrade, Ethelston, is three
years my senior; in action he is always by my side, sometimes
before me; he has more skill or riper judgment; any
promotion, that should prefer me before him, would be most
painful to me.” He bowed and withdrew. On the following
day, the same officer, who had mentioned Reginald’s conduct
to the Archduke, presented both the friends, from him, with a
gold medal of the Emperor; a distinction the more gratifying
to Reginald, from his knowledge that <i>he</i> had been secretly the
means of bringing his friend’s merit into the notice of his
commander.</p>

<p>They served through the remainder of that campaign, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the arms of the contending parties met with alternate success:
towards its close, the Archduke having skilfully effected his object
of uniting his forces to the corps d’armée under General
Wartenleben, compelled the French to evacuate Franconia, and
to retire towards Switzerland.</p>

<p>This retreat was conducted with much skill by General
Moreau; several times did the French rear&ndash;guard make an
obstinate stand against the pursuers, among whom Reginald
and his comrades were always the foremost. On one occasion,
the French army occupied a position so strong that they were
not driven from it without heavy loss on both sides; and even
after the force of numbers had compelled the main body to
retire, there remained a gallant band who seemed resolved to
conquer or die upon the field. In vain did the Austrian leaders,
in admiration of their devoted valour, call to them to surrender:
without yielding an inch of ground, they fell fighting where
they stood. Reginald made the most desperate efforts to save
their young commander, whose chivalrous appearance and
brilliantly decorated uniform made him remarkable from a
great distance: several times did he strike aside a barrel
pointed at the French officer; but it was too late; and when
at length, covered with dust, and sweat, and blood, he reached
the spot, he found the young hero, whom he had striven to
save, stretched on the ground by several mortal wounds in his
breast; he saw, however, Reginald’s kind intention, smiled
gratefully upon him, waved his sword over his head, and died.</p>

<p>The excitement of the battle was over; and leaning on his
sword, Reginald still bent over the noble form and marble
features of the young warrior at his feet; and he sighed deeply
when he thought how suddenly had this flower of manly
beauty been cut down. “Perhaps,” said he, half aloud,
“some now childless mother yet waits for this last prop of her
age and name; or some betrothed lingers at her window, and
wonders why he so long delays.”</p>

<p>Ethelston was at his side, his eyes also bent sadly upon the
same object: the young friends interchanged a warm and silent
grasp of the hand, each feeling that he read the heart of
the other! At this moment, a groan escaped from a wounded
man, who was half buried under the bleeding bodies of his
comrades: with some difficulty Reginald dragged him out from
below them, and the poor fellow thanked him for his humanity:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he had only received a slight wound on the head from a spent
ball, which had stunned him for the time; but he soon recovered
from its effects, and looking around, he saw the body of
the young commander stretched on the plain.</p>

<p>“<i>Ah, mon pauvre Général!</i>” he exclaimed: and on further
inquiry, Reginald learnt that it was indeed the gallant, the admired,
the beloved General Marceau, whose brilliant career
was thus untimely closed.</p>

<p>“I will go,” whispered Ethelston, “and bear these tidings
to the Archduke; meantime, Reginald, guard the honoured remains
from the camp&ndash;spoiler and the plunderer.” So saying
he withdrew: and Reginald, stooping over the prostrate form
before him, stretched it decently, closed the eyes, and, throwing
a mantle over the splendid uniform, sat down to indulge in the
serious meditations inspired by the scene.</p>

<p>He was soon aroused from them by the poor fellow whom
he had dragged forth, who said to him, “Sir, I yield myself
your prisoner.”</p>

<p>“And who are you, my friend?”</p>

<p>“I was courier, valet, and cook to M. de Vareuil, aide&ndash;de&ndash;camp
to the General Marceau; both lie dead together before
you.”</p>

<p>“And what is your name, my good fellow?”</p>

<p>“Gustave Adolphe Montmorenci Perrot.”</p>

<p>“A fair string of names, indeed,” said Reginald, smiling.
“But pray, Monsieur Perrot, how came you here? are you a
soldier as well as a courier?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur does me too much honour,” said the other,
shrugging his shoulders. “I only came from the baggage&ndash;train
with a message to my master, and your avant&ndash;garde peppered
us so hotly that I could not get back again. I am not
fond of fighting: but somehow, when I saw poor Monsieur de
Vareuil in so sad a plight, I did not wish to leave him.”</p>

<p>Reginald looked at the speaker, and thought he had never
seen in one face such a compound of slyness and honesty,
drollery and sadness. He did not, however, reply, and relapsed
into his meditation. Before five minutes had passed,
Monsieur Perrot, as if struck by a sudden idea, fell on his
knees before Reginald, and said,</p>

<p>“Monsieur has saved my life—will he grant me yet one
favour?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“If within my power,” said Reginald, good&ndash;humouredly.</p>

<p>“Will Monsieur take me into his service? I have travelled
over all Europe; I have lived long in Paris, London,
Vienna; I may be of use to Monsieur; but I have no home
now.”</p>

<p>“Nay, but Monsieur Perrot, I want no servant; I am only
a volunteer with the army.”</p>

<p>“I see what Monsieur is,” said Perrot, archly, “in spite
of the dust and blood with which he is disfigured. I will ask
no salary; I will share your black bread, if you are poor, and
will live in your pantry, if you are rich: I only want to serve
you.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Perrot’s importunity overruled all the objections
that Reginald could raise; and he at last consented to the arrangement,
provided the former, after due reflection, should
adhere to his wish.</p>

<p>Ethelston meanwhile returned with the party sent by the
Archduke to pay the last token of respect to the remains of the
youthful General. They were interred with all the military
honours due to an officer whose reputation was, considering his
years, second to none in France, save that of Napoleon
himself.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, Monsieur Perrot, now on parole not to
bear arms against Austria, obtained leave to return to the
French camp for a week, in order to “arrange his affairs,” at
the expiration of which he promised to rejoin his new master.
Ethelston blamed Reginald for his thoughtlessness in engaging
this untried attendant. The latter, however, laughed at his
friend, and said, “Though he is such a droll&ndash;looking creature,
I think there is good in him; at all events, rest assured I will
not trust him far without trial.”</p>

<p>A few weeks after these events, General Moreau having
effected his retreat into Switzerland, an armistice was concluded
on the Rhine between the contending armies; and
Reginald could no longer resist the imperative commands of
his uncle to return to Shirley Hall. Monsieur Gustave
Adolphe Montmorenci Perrot had joined his new master, with
a valise admirably stocked, and wearing a peruke of a most
fashionable cut. Ethelston shrewdly suspected that these had
formed part of Monsieur de Vareuil’s wardrobe, and his dislike
of Reginald’s foppish valet was not thereby diminished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>On the route to Hamburgh the friends passed through
many places where the luxuries, and even the necessaries of
life, had been rendered scarce by the late campaign. Here
Perrot was in his element; fatigue seemed to be unknown
to him; he was always ready, active, useful as a courier,
and unequalled as a cook or a caterer; so that Ethelston was
compelled to confess, that if he only proved honest, Reginald
had indeed found a treasure.</p>

<p>At Hamburgh the two friends took an affectionate farewell,
promising to meet each other in the course of the following
year on the banks of the Ohio. Reginald returned to his
uncle, who stormed dreadfully when he learnt that he had
brought with him a French valet, and remained implacable, in
spite of the circumstances under which he had been engaged;
until one morning, when a footman threw down the tray on
which he was carrying up the squire’s breakfast of beef&ndash;steaks
and stewed kidneys, half an hour before “the meet” at his
best cover&ndash;side. What could now be done? The cook was
sulky, and sent word that there were no more steaks nor kidneys
to be had. The squire was wrath and hungry. Reginald
laughed, and said, “Uncle, send for Perrot.”</p>

<p>“Perrot be d—d!” cried the squire. “Does the boy
think I want some pomatum? What else can that coxcomb
give me?”</p>

<p>“May I try him, uncle?” said Reginald, still laughing.</p>

<p>“You may try him: but if he plays any of his jackanapes
pranks, I’ll tan his hide for him, I promise you!”</p>

<p>Reginald having rung for Perrot, pointed to the remains of
the good things which a servant was still gathering up, and
said to him, “Send up breakfast for Mr. Shirley and myself
in one quarter of an hour from this minute: you are permitted
to use what you find in the larder; but be punctual.”</p>

<p>Perrot bowed, and, without speaking, disappeared.</p>

<p>“The devil take the fellow! he has <i>some</i> sense,” said the
angry squire; “he can receive an order without talking; one
of my hulking knaves would have stood there five minutes out
of the fifteen, saying, ‘Yes, sir; I’ll see what can be done;’
or, ‘I’ll ask Mr. Alltripe,’ or some other infernal stuff. Come,
Reginald, look at your watch. Let us stroll to the stable;
we’ll be back to a minute; and if that fellow plays any of
his French tricks upon me, I’ll give it him.” So saying, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
jolly squire cut the head off one of his gardener’s favourite
plants with his hunting whip, and led the way to the stable.</p>

<p>We may now return to Monsieur Perrot, and see how he set
about the discharge of his sudden commission; but it may be
necessary, at the same time, to explain one or two particulars
not known to his master or to the squire. Monsieur Perrot
was very gallant, and his tender heart had been smitten by
the charms of Mary, the still&ndash;room maid; it so happened on
this very morning that he had prepared slyly, as a surprise, a
little <i>déjeûner à la fourchette</i>, with which he intended to
soften Mary’s obduracy. We will not inquire <i>how</i> he had obtained
the mushroom, the lemon, and the sundry other good
things with which he was busily engaged in dressing a plump
hen&ndash;pheasant, when he received the above unexpected summons.
Monsieur Perrot’s vanity was greater than either his
gourmandise or his love; and, without hesitation, he determined
to sacrifice to it the hen&ndash;pheasant: his first step was to
run to the still&ndash;room; and having stolen a kiss from Mary,
and received a box on the ear as a reward, he gave her two or
three very brief but important hints for the coffee, which was
to be made immediately; he then turned his attention to the
hen&ndash;pheasant, sliced some bacon, cut up a ham, took possession
of a whole basket of eggs, and flew about the kitchen with
such surprising activity, and calling for so many things at
once, that Mr. Alltripe left his dominion, and retired to his
own room in high dudgeon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the squire, having sauntered through the stables
with Reginald, and enlightened him with various comments
upon the points and qualities of his favourite hunters, took out
his watch, and exclaimed, “The time is up, my boy; let us
go in and see what your precious mounseer has got for us.”
As they entered the library, Monsieur opened the opposite
door, and announced breakfast as quietly and composedly as if
no unusual demand had been made upon his talents. The
squire led the way into the breakfast&ndash;room, and was scarcely
more surprised than was Reginald himself at the viands that
regaled his eye on the table. In addition to the brown and
white loaves, the rolls, and other varieties of bread, there
smoked on one dish the delicate salmi of pheasant, on another
the squire’s favourite dish of bacon, with poached eggs, and
on a third a most tempting <i>omelette au jambon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Marmaduke Shirley opened his eyes and mouth wide with
astonishment, as Monsieur Perrot offered him, one after another,
these delicacies, inquiring, with undisturbed gravity, if
“Monsieur desired any thing else? as there were other dishes
ready below?”</p>

<p>“Other dishes! why, man, here’s a breakfast for a court of
aldermen,” said the squire; and having ascertained that the
things were as agreeable to the taste as to the eye, and that the
coffee was more clear and high&ndash;flavoured than he had ever
tasted before, he seized his nephew’s hand, saying, “Reginald,
my boy, I give in; your Master Perrot’s a trump, and no
man shall ever speak a word against him in this house! A
rare fellow!” Here he took another turn at the omelette;
“hang me if he shan’t have a day’s sport;” and the squire
chuckling at the idea that had suddenly crossed him, rang the
bell violently: “Tell Repton,” said he to the servant who
entered, “to saddle ‘Rattling Bess,’ for Monsieur Perrot, and
to take her to the cover&ndash;side with the other horses at ten.”</p>

<p>“She kicks a bit at starting,” added he to Reginald; “but
she’s as safe as a mill; and though she rushes now and then
at the fences, she always gets through or over ‘em.”</p>

<p>Now it was poor Perrot’s turn to be astonished. To do him
justice, he was neither a bad horseman (as a courier) nor a
coward; but he had never been out with hounds, and the
enumeration of “Rattling Bess’” qualities did not sound very
attractive to his ear: he began gently to make excuses, and to
decline the proposed favour: he had not the “proper dress:”—“he
had much to do for Monsieur’s wardrobe at home:”
but it was all to no purpose, the squire was determined;
Repton’s coat and breeches would fit him, and go he <i>must</i>.</p>

<p>With a rueful look at his master, Perrot slunk off, cursing
in his heart the salmi and the omelette, which had procured
him this undesired favour: but he was ordered to lose no time
in preparing himself; so he first endeavoured to get into Mr.
Repton’s clothes: that proved impossible, as Mr. R. <i>had</i> been
a racing jockey, and was a feather&ndash;weight, with legs like nutcrackers.
Having no time for deliberation, Monsieur Perrot
drew from his valise the courier suit which he had worn in
France; and to the surprise of the whole party assembled at
the door, he appeared clad in a blue coat turned up with yellow,
a cornered hat, and enormous boots, half a foot higher than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
his knees. He was ordered to jump up behind the squire’s
carriage, and away they went to the cover&ndash;side, amid the ill&ndash;suppressed
titter of the grooms and footmen, and the loud
laughter of the maids, whose malicious faces, not excepting
that of Mary, were at the open windows below.</p>

<p>When they reached the place appointed for “the meet,”
and proceeded to mount the impatient horses awaiting them,
Perrot eyed with no agreeable anticipation the long ears of
Rattling Bess laid back, and the restless wag of her rat&ndash;tail,
and he ventured one more attempt at an escape. “Really,
sir,” said he to the squire, “I never hunted, and I don’t
think I can manage that animal; she looks very savage.”</p>

<p>“Never mind her, Monsieur Perrot,” said the squire, enjoying
the poor valet’s ill&ndash;dissembled uneasiness. “She knows
her business here as well as any whipper&ndash;in or huntsman;
only let her go her own way, and you’ll never be far from the
brush.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” muttered Perrot; “I hope <i>she</i> knows <i>her</i> business;
I know mine, and that is to keep on her back, which
I’ll do as well as I can.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the whole field were upon this strangely attired
figure; and as soon as he got into the saddle, “Rattling
Bess” began to kick and plunge violently: we have said that
he was not in some respects a bad horseman; and although in
this, her first prank, he lost one of his stirrups, and his cornered
hat fell off, he contrived to keep both his seat and his
temper: while the hounds were drawing the cover, one of the
squire’s grooms restored the hat, and gave him a string wherewith
to fasten it, an operation which he had scarcely concluded,
when the inspiring shouts of “Tally ho,” “Gone away,”
“Forward,” rang on his ears. “Rattling Bess” seemed to
understand the sounds as well as ever alderman knew a dinner&ndash;bell;
and away she went at full gallop, convincing Monsieur
Perrot, after an ineffectual struggle of a few minutes on his
part, that both the speed and direction of her course were
matters over which he could not exercise the smallest influence.</p>

<p>On they flew, over meadow and stile, ditch and hedge, nothing
seemed to check Rattling Bess; and while all the field
were in astonished admiration at the reckless riding of the
strange courier, that worthy was catching his breath, and muttering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
through his teeth, “Diable d’animal, she have a
mouth so hard, like one of Mr. Alltripe’s bif&ndash;steak,—she know
her business—and a sacré business it is—holà there! mind
yourself!” shouted he, at the top of his voice, to a horseman
whose horse had fallen in brushing through a thick hedge, and
was struggling to rise on the other side just as Rattling Bess
followed at tremendous speed over the same place; lighting
upon the hind&ndash;quarters of her hapless predecessor, and scraping
all the skin off his loins, she knocked the rider head over heels
into the ploughed field, where his face was buried a foot deep
in dirty mould: by a powerful effort she kept herself from
falling, and went gallantly over the field; Perrot still muttering,
as he tugged at the insensible mouth, “She know her
business, she kill dat poor devil in the dirt, she kill herself and
me too.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the hounds, having overrun the scent,
came to a check, and were gathered by the huntsman into a
green lane, from whence they were about to “try back” as
Rattling Bess came up at unabated speed. “Hold hard
there, hold hard!” shouted at once the huntsman, the whips,
and the few sportsmen who were up with the hounds.
“Where the devil are you going, man?” “The fox is
viewed back.” “Halloo!—you’re riding into the middle of
the pack.” These and similar cries scarcely had time to reach
the ears of Perrot, ere “Rattling Bess” sprang over the
hedge into a green lane, and coming down upon the unfortunate
dogs, split the head of one, broke the back of another,
and, laming two or three more, carried her rider over the opposite
fence, who, still panting for breath, with his teeth set,
muttered, “She know her business, sacré animal.”</p>

<p>After crossing two more fields, she cleared a hedge, so thick
that he could not see what was on the other side; but he heard
a tremendous crash, and was only conscious of being hurled
with violence to the ground: slowly recovering his senses, he
saw Rattling Bess lying a few yards from him, bleeding profusely;
and his own ears were saluted by the following compassionate
inquiry from the lips of a gardener, who was
standing over him, spade in hand: “D—n your stupid outlandish
head, what be you a doin’ here?”</p>

<p>The half&ndash;stunned courier, pointing to Rattling Bess, replied:
“She know her business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The gardener, though enraged at the entire demolition of
his melon&ndash;bed, and of sundry forced vegetables under glass,
was not an ill&ndash;tempered fellow in the main; and seeing that
the horse was half killed, and the rider, a foreigner, much
bruised, he assisted poor Perrot to rise; and having gathered
from him that he was in the service of rich Squire Shirley,
rendered all the aid in his power to him and to Rattling Bess,
who had received some very severe cuts from the glass.</p>

<p>When the events of the day came to be talked over at the
Hall, and it proved that it was the squire himself whom Perrot
had so unceremoniously ridden over,—that the huntsman
would expect some twenty guineas for the hounds killed or
maimed—that the gardener would probably present a similar
or a larger account for a broken melon&ndash;bed and shivered glass—<i>and</i>
that Rattling Bess was lame for the season, the squire
did not encourage much conversation on the day’s sport; the
only remark that he was heard to make, being, “What a fool
I was to put a frog&ndash;eating Frenchman on an English hunter!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Perrot remained in his room for three or four
days, not caring that Mary should see his visage while it was
adorned with a black eye and an inflamed nose.</p>

<p>Soon after this eventful chase, Reginald obtained his uncle’s
leave to obey his father’s wishes by visiting Paris for a few
months. His stay there was shortened by a letter which he received
from his sister Lucy, announcing to him his mother’s
illness; on the receipt of which he wrote a few hurried lines
of explanation to his uncle, and sailed by the first ship for Philadelphia,
accompanied by the faithful Perrot, and by a large
rough dog of the breed of the old Irish wolf&ndash;hound, given to
him by the squire.</p>

<p>On arriving, he found his mother better than he had expected;
and, as he kissed off the tears of joy which Lucy shed
on his return, he whispered to her his belief that she had a little
exaggerated their mother’s illness, in order to recall him. After
a short time, Ethelston also returned, and joined the happy
circle assembled at Colonel Brandon’s.</p>

<p>It was now the spring of 1797, between which time and
that mentioned as the date of our opening chapter, a period
of nearly two years, nothing worthy of peculiar record occurred.
Reginald kept up a faithful correspondence with his
kind uncle, whose letters showed how deeply he felt his nephew’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
absence. Whether Monsieur Perrot interchanged
letters with Mary, or consoled himself with the damsels on the
banks of the Ohio, the following pages may show. His
master made several hunting excursions, on which he was
always accompanied by Baptiste, a sturdy backwoodsman, who
was more deeply attached to Reginald than to any other being on
earth; and Ethelston had, as we have before explained, undertaken
the whole charge of his guardian’s vessels, with one
of the largest of which he was, at the commencement of our
tale, absent in the West India Islands.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN ADVENTURE IN THE WOODS.—REGINALD BRANDON MAKES THE
ACQUAINTANCE OF AN INDIAN CHIEF.</p>

<p class="pn">It was a bright morning in April; the robin was beginning
his early song, the woodpecker darted his beak against the
rough bark, and the squirrel hopped merrily from bough to
bough among the gigantic trees of the forest, as two hunters
followed a winding path which led to a ferry across the Muskingum
river.</p>

<p>One was a powerful athletic young man, with a countenance
strikingly handsome, and embrowned by exercise and exposure:
his dress was a hunting shirt, and leggings of deer&ndash;skin;
his curling brown locks escaped from under a cap of
wolf&ndash;skin; and his mocassins, firmly secured round the ankle,
were made from the tough hide of a bear: he carried in his
hand a short rifle of heavy calibre, and an ornamented couteau&ndash;de&ndash;chasse
hung at his belt. His companion, lower in stature,
but broad, sinewy, and weather&ndash;beaten, seemed to be some
fifteen or twenty years the elder: his dress was of the same
material, but more soiled and worn; his rifle was longer and
heavier; and his whole appearance that of a man to whom all
inclemencies of season were indifferent, all the dangers and
hardships of a western hunter’s life familiar; but the most
remarkable part of his equipment was an enormous axe, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
handle studded with nails, and the head firmly riveted with
iron hoops.</p>

<p>“Well, Master Reginald,” said the latter; “we must hope
to find old Michael and his ferry&ndash;boat at the Passage des
Rochers, for the river is much swollen, and we might not
easily swim it with dry powder.”</p>

<p>“What reason have you to doubt old Michael’s being found
at his post?” said Reginald: “we have often crossed there,
and have seldom found him absent.”</p>

<p>“True, master; but he has of late become very lazy; and
he prefers sitting by his fire, and exchanging a bottle of fire&ndash;water
with a strolling Ingian for half a dozen good skins, to
tugging a great flat&ndash;bottomed boat across the Muskingum
during the March floods.”</p>

<p>“Baptiste,” said the young man, “it grieves me to see the
reckless avidity with which spirits are sought by the Indians;
and the violence, outrage, and misery which is the general
consequence of their dram&ndash;drinking.”</p>

<p>“Why you see, there is something very good in a cup of
West Ingy rum.” Here Baptiste’s hard features were twisted
into a grin irresistibly comic, and he proceeded: “It warms
the stomach and the heart; and the savages, when they once
taste it, suck at a bottle by instinct, as natural as a six&ndash;weeks’
cub at his dam. I often wonder, Master Reginald, why you
spoil that fine <i>eau de vie</i> which little Perrot puts into your
hunting flask, by mixing with it a quantity of water! In my
last trip to the mountains, where I was first guide and turpret<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
they gave me a taste now and then, and I never found
it do me harm; but the nature of an Ingian is different, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Well, Baptiste,” said Reginald, smiling at his follower’s
defence of his favourite beverage; “I will say that I never
knew you to take more than you could carry; but your head
is as strong as your back, and you sometimes prove the strength
of both.”</p>

<p>The conversation was suddenly interrupted by the report of
Reginald’s rifle, and a grey squirrel fell from the top of a
hickory, where he was feasting in fancied security. Baptiste
took up the little animal, and having examined it attentively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
shook his head gravely, saying, “Master Reginald, there is
not a quicker eye, nor a truer hand in the territory, but—“</p>

<p>As he hesitated to finish the sentence, Reginald added,
laughing, “but—but—I am an obstinate fellow, because I
will not exchange my favourite German rifle, with its heavy
bullet, for a long Virginia barrel, with a ball like a pea; is it
not so, Baptiste?”</p>

<p>The guide’s natural good&ndash;humour struggled with prejudices
which, on this subject, had been more than once wounded by
his young companion, as he replied, “Why, Master Reginald,
the deer, whose saddle is on my shoulder, found my pea hard
enough to swallow; and look here, at this poor little vermint,
whom you have just killed,—there is a hole in his neck big
enough to let the life out of a grisly bear; you have hit him
nearly an inch further back than I taught you to aim before
you went across the great water, and learnt all kinds of British
and German notions!”</p>

<p>Reginald smiled at the hunter’s characteristic reproof, and
replied, in a tone of kindness, “Well, Baptiste, all that I do
know of tracking a deer, or lining a bee, or of bringing down
one of these little vermint, I learnt first from you; and if I
am a promising pupil, the credit is due to Baptiste, the best
hunter in forest or prairie!”</p>

<p>A glow of pleasure passed over the guide’s sunburnt countenance;
and grasping in his hard and horny fingers his
young master’s hand, he said, “Thank’ee, Master Reginald;
and as for me, though I’m only a poor ‘Coureur des bois,’<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
I a’n’t feared to back my pupil against any man that walks,
from Dan Boone, of Kentucky, to Bloody&ndash;hand, the great
war&ndash;chief of the Cayugas.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, they came in sight of the river, and the blue
smoke curling up among the trees showed our travellers that
they had not missed their path to Michael’s log&ndash;house and
ferry. “What have we here?” exclaimed Baptiste, catching
his companion by the arm; “’tis even as I told you; the old
rogue is smoking his pipe over a glass of brandy in his kitchen
corner; and there is a wild&ndash;looking Indian pulling himself
across with three horses in that crazy batteau, almost as old
and useless as its owner!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“He will scarcely reach the opposite bank,” said Reginald;
“the river is muddy and swollen with melted snow, and his
horses seem disposed to be unquiet passengers.”</p>

<p>They had now approached near enough to enable them
to distinguish the features of the Indian in the boat: the
guide scanned them with evident surprise and interest; the
result of which was, a noise which broke from him, something
between a grunt and a whistle, as he muttered, “What can
have brought <i>him</i> here?”</p>

<p>“Do you know that fine&ndash;looking fellow, then?” inquired
Reginald.</p>

<p>“Know him, Master Reginald—does Wolf know Miss
Lucy?—does a bear know a bee tree? I should know him among
a thousand red&ndash;skins, though he were twice as well disguised.
Tête&ndash;bleu, master, look at those wild brutes how they struggle;
he and they will taste Muskingum water before long.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking one of the horses reared, another
kicked furiously, the shallow flat boat was upset, and both
they and the Indian fell headlong into the river. They had
been secured together by a “laryette,” or thong of hide, which
unfortunately came athwart the Indian’s shoulder, and thus he
was held below the water, while the struggles of the frightened
animals rendered it impossible for him to extricate himself.
“He is entangled in the laryette,” said the guide; “nothing
can save him,” he added in a grave and sadder tone. “’Tis
a noble youth, and I would have wished him a braver death!
What are you doing, Master Reginald?—are you mad?
No man can swim in that torrent. For your father’s sake—“</p>

<p>But his entreaties and attempts to restrain his impetuous
companion were fruitless, for Reginald had already thrown on
the ground his leathern hunting shirt, his rifle, and ammunition;
and shaking off the grasp of the guide as if the latter
had been a child, he plunged into the river, and swam to the
spot where the feebler struggles of the horses showed that they
were now almost at the mercy of the current. When he
reached them, Reginald dived below the nearest, and dividing
the laryette with two or three successful strokes of his knife,
brought the exhausted Indian to the surface. For a moment,
he feared that he had come too late; but on inhaling a
breath of air, the red&ndash;skin seemed to regain both consciousness
and strength, and was able in his turn to assist Reginald, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
had received, when under water, a blow on the head from the
horse’s hoof, the blood flowing fast from the wound. Short
but expressive was the greeting exchanged as they struck out
for the bank, which one of the horses had already gained:
another was bruised, battered, and tossed about among some
shelving rocks lower down the river; and the third was
being fast hurried towards the same dangerous spot, when the
Indian, uttering a shrill cry, turned and swam again towards
this, his favourite horse, and by a great exertion of skill and
strength, brought it to a part of the river where the current
was less rapid, and thence led it safely ashore.</p>

<p>These events had passed in less time than their narration
has occupied: and the whole biped and quadruped party now
stood drenched and dripping on the bank. The two young
men gazed at each other in silence, with looks of mingled
interest and admiration: indeed, if a sculptor had desired to
place together two different specimens of youthful manhood,
in which symmetry and strength were to be gracefully united,
he could scarcely have selected two finer models: in height
they might be about equal; and though the frame and muscular
proportions of Reginald were more powerful, there was
a roundness and compact knitting of the joints, and a sinewy
suppleness in the limbs of his new acquaintance, such as he
thought he had never seen equalled in statuary or in life. The
Indian’s gaze was so fixed and piercing, that Reginald’s eye
wandered more than once from his countenance to the belt,
where his war&ndash;club was still suspended by a thong, the scalp&ndash;knife
in its sheath, and near it a scalp, evidently that of a
white man, and bearing the appearance of having been
recently taken.</p>

<p>With a slight shudder of disgust, he raised his eyes again
to the chiselled features of the noble&ndash;looking being before him,
and felt assured that though they might be those of a savage
warrior, they could not be those of a lurking assassin. The
Indian now moved a step forward, and taking Reginald’s
hand, placed it upon his own heart, saying distinctly in English,
“My brother!”</p>

<p>Reginald understood and appreciated this simple expression
of gratitude and friendship; he imitated his new friend’s
action, and evinced, both by his looks and the kindly tones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
his voice, the interest which, to his own surprise, the Indian
had awakened in his breast.</p>

<p>At this juncture they were joined by the guide, who had
paddled himself across in a canoe that he found at the ferry,
which was two hundred yards above the spot where they now
stood. At his approach, the young Indian resumed his silent
attitude of repose; while, apparently unconscious of his presence,
Baptiste poured upon his favourite a mingled torrent of
reproofs and congratulations.</p>

<p>“Why, Master Reginald, did the mad spirit possess you to
jump into the Muskingum, and dive like an otter, where the
water was swift and dark as the Niagara rapids! Pardie,
though, it was bravely done! another minute, and our red&ndash;skin
friend would have been in the hunting&ndash;ground of his forefathers.
Give me your hand, master; I love you better than
ever! I had a mind to take a duck myself after ye; but
thought, if bad luck came, I might serve ye better with the
canoe.” While rapidly uttering these broken sentences, he
handed to Reginald the hunting&ndash;shirt, rifle, and other things,
which he had brought over in the canoe, and wrung the water
out of his cap, being all the time in a state of ill&ndash;dissembled
excitement. This done, he turned to the young Indian, who
was standing aside, silent and motionless. The guide scanned
his features with a searching look, and then muttered audibly,
“I knew it must be he.”</p>

<p>A gleam shot from the dark eye of the Indian, proving that
he heard and understood the phrase, but not a word escaped
his lips.</p>

<p>Reginald, unable to repress his curiosity, exclaimed, “Must
be who, Baptiste? Who is my Indian friend—my brother?”</p>

<p>A lurking smile played round the mouth of the guide, as
he said in a low tone to the Indian, “Does the paint on my
brother’s face tell a tale? Is his path in the night? Must his
name dwell between shut lips?”</p>

<p>To this last question the Indian, moving forward with that
peculiar grace and innate dignity which characterised all his
movements, replied, “The War&ndash;Eagle hides his name from
none: his cry is heard from far, and his path is straight: a dog’s
scalp is at his belt!” Here he paused a moment; and added,
in a softened tone, “But the bad Spirit prevailed: the waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
were too strong for him; the swimming&ndash;warrior’s knife came;
and again the War&ndash;Eagle saw the light.”</p>

<p>“And found a brother—is it not so?” added Reginald.</p>

<p>“It is so!” replied the Indian: and there was a depth of
pathos in the tone of his voice as he spoke, which convinced
Reginald that those words came from the heart.</p>

<p>“There were three horses with you in the bac,” said the
guide: “two are under yonder trees;—where is the third?”</p>

<p>“Dead, among those rocks below the rapids,” answered
War&ndash;Eagle, quietly. “He was a fool, and was taken from a
fool, and both are now together;” as he spoke he pointed
scornfully to the scalp which hung at his belt.</p>

<p>Reginald and Baptiste interchanged looks of uneasy curiosity,
and then directing their eyes towards the distant spot
indicated by the Indian, they distinguished the battered carcass
of the animal, partly hid by the water, and partly resting
against the rock, which prevented it from floating down with
the current.</p>

<p>The party now turned towards the horses among the trees;
which, after enjoying themselves by rolling in the grass, were
feeding, apparently unconscious of their double misdemeanor,
in having first upset the bac, and then nearly drowned their
master by their struggles in the water. As Reginald and his
two companions approached, an involuntary exclamation of
admiration burst from him.</p>

<p>“Heavens, Baptiste! did you ever see so magnificent a
creature as that with the laryette round his neck? And what
a colour! it seems between chestnut and black! Look at his
short, wild head, his broad forehead, his bold eye, and that
long silky mane falling below his shoulder! Look, also, at
his short back and legs! Why, he has the beauty of a barb
joined to the strength of an English hunter!”</p>

<p>It may be well imagined that the greater portion of this
might have been a soliloquy, as Baptiste understood but few,
the Indian none, of the expressions which Reginald uttered
with enthusiastic rapidity. Both, however, understood enough
to know that he was admiring the animal, and both judged
that his admiration was not misplaced.</p>

<p>Our hero (for so we must denominate Reginald Brandon)
approached to handle and caress the horse; but the latter, with
erect ears and expanded nostrils, snorted an indignant refusal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of these civilities and trotted off, tossing high his mane as if
in defiance of man’s dominion. At this moment, the War&ndash;Eagle
uttered a shrill, peculiar cry, when immediately the
obedient horse came to his side, rubbing his head against his
master’s shoulder, and courting those caresses which he had so
lately and so scornfully refused from Reginald.</p>

<p>While the docile and intelligent animal thus stood beside
him, a sudden ray of light sparkled in the Indian’s eye, as
with rapid utterance, not unmingled with gesticulation, he said,
“The War&ndash;Eagle’s path was toward the evening sun; his
tomahawk drank the Camanchee’s blood; the wild horse was
swift, and strong, and fierce; the cunning man on the evening
prairie said he was <i>Nekimi</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>,—‘the Great Spirit’s angry
breath;’ but the War&ndash;Eagle’s neck&ndash;bullet struck—“</p>

<p>At this part of the narrative, the guide, carried away by the
enthusiasm of the scene described, ejaculated, in the Delaware
tongue, “That was bravely done!”</p>

<p>For a moment the young Indian paused; and then, with
increased rapidity and vehemence, told in his own language
how he had captured and subdued the horse; which faithful
creature, seemingly anxious to bear witness to the truth of his
master’s tale, still sought and returned his caresses. The Indian,
however, was not thereby deterred from the purpose
which had already made his eye flash with pleasure. Taking
the thong in his hand, and placing it in that of Reginald, he
said, resuming the English tongue, “The War&ndash;Eagle gives
Nekimi to his brother. The white warrior may hunt the
mastoche<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, he may overtake his enemies, he may fly from the
prairie&ndash;fire when the wind is strong: Nekimi never tires!”</p>

<p>Reginald was so surprised at this unexpected offer, that he
felt much embarrassed, and hesitated whether he ought not to
decline the gift. Baptiste saw a cloud gathering on the
Indian’s brow, and said in a low voice to his master, in French,
“You must take the horse; a refusal would mortally offend
him.” Our hero accordingly accompanied his expression of
thanks with every demonstration of satisfaction and affection.
Again War&ndash;Eagle’s face brightened with pleasure; but the
effect upon Nekimi seemed to be very different, for he stoutly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
resisted his new master’s attempts at approach or acquaintance,
snorting and backing at every step made by Reginald in
advance.</p>

<p>“The white warrior must learn to speak to Nekimi,”
said the Indian, quietly; and he again repeated the short,
shrill cry before noticed. In vain our hero tried to imitate
the sound; the horse’s ears remained deaf to his voice, and it
seemed as if his new acquisition could prove but of little
service to him.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle now took Reginald aside, and smeared his hands
with some grease taken from a small bladder in his girdle, and
on his extending them again towards the horse, much of the
fear and dislike evinced by the latter disappeared. As soon as
the animal would permit Reginald to touch it, the Indian
desired him to hold its nostril firmly in his hand, and placing
his face by the horse’s head, to look up steadfastly into its eye
for several minutes, speaking low at intervals to accustom it
to his voice: he assured him that in a few days Nekimi would
through this treatment become docile and obedient.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">REGINALD AND BAPTISTE PAY A VISIT TO WAR&ndash;EAGLE.—AN ATTEMPT
AT TREACHERY MEETS WITH SUMMARY PUNISHMENT.</p>

<p class="pn">The other horse being now secured, the party prepared to
resume their journey; and as it appeared, after a few words
whispered between the Indian and the guide, that their routes
were in the same direction, they struck into the forest, Baptiste
leading, followed by Reginald, and War&ndash;Eagle bringing up
the rear with the two horses.</p>

<p>After walking a few minutes in silence, “Baptiste,” said
our hero, in French, “what was the story told about the
horse? I understood little of what he said in English, and
none of what he spoke in his own tongue.”</p>

<p>“He told us, Master Reginald, that he was out on a war&ndash;party
against the Camanchees, a wild tribe of Indians in the
South west: they steal horses from the Mexicans, and exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
them with the <i>Aricarás</i>, Kioways, Pawnees, and other Missouri
Indians.”</p>

<p>“Well, Baptiste, how did he take this swift horse with
his ‘neck&ndash;bullet,’ as he called it?”</p>

<p>“That, Master Reginald, is the most difficult shot in the
prairie; and I have known few red&ndash;skins up to it. The
western hunters call it ‘creasing:’—a ball must be shot just
on the upper edge of the spine where it enters the horse’s
neck: if it is exactly done, the horse falls immediately, and is
secured; then the wound is afterwards healed: but if the
ball strikes an inch lower, the spine is missed, or the horse
is killed. Few red&ndash;skins can do it,” muttered the guide; “and
the ‘doctor’ here,” shaking his long rifle, “has failed more
than once; but War&ndash;Eagle has said it, and there are no lies
in <i>his</i> mouth.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Baptiste,” said Reginald, earnestly; “tell me
something about my brother’s history, his race, and exploits.”</p>

<p>“Afterwards, my young master. I know not that he understands
us now; but these Indians are curious critturs in
hearing; I believe if you spoke in that strange Dutch lingo
which you learnt across the water, the red&ndash;skins would know
how to answer you—stay,” added he, putting his rifle to his
shoulder, “here is work for the doctor.”</p>

<p>Reginald looked in the direction of the piece, but saw
nothing; and the guide, while taking his aim, still muttered
to himself, “The pills are very small, but they work somewhat
sharp.” Pausing a moment, he drew the trigger; and a
sudden bound from under a brake, at fifty yards’ distance, was
the last death&ndash;spring of the unlucky deer whose lair had not
escaped the hunter’s practised eye.</p>

<p>“Bravely shot,” shouted Reginald; “what says War&ndash;Eagle?”</p>

<p>“Good,” replied the Indian.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Baptiste; “there was not much in the shot;
but your French waly&ndash;de&ndash;sham might have walked past those
bushes without noting the twinkle of that crittur’s eye. Our
red&ndash;skin friend saw it plain enough, I warrant you,” added he,
with an inquiring look.</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle’s path is not on the deer track,” said the young
chief, with a stern gravity.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes an additional load of venison was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
across the sturdy shoulders of the guide, and the party resumed
their march in silence.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far, when the Indian halted, saying,
“War&ndash;Eagle’s camp is near; will my white brother eat and
smoke?—the sun is high; he can then return to his great
wigwam.”</p>

<p>Reginald, who was anxious to see more of his new friend,
and in whom the morning’s exercise had awakened a strong
relish for a slice of broiled venison, assented at once, and
desired him to lead the way.</p>

<p>As he was still followed by the two horses, War&ndash;Eagle
was somewhat in advance of his companions, and Baptiste
whispered, in French, “Beware, Master Reginald—you may
fall into a trap.”</p>

<p>“For shame,” said the latter, colouring with indignation;
“can you suspect treachery in <i>him</i>? Did you not yourself
say he could not lie?”</p>

<p>“Your reproof is undeserved,” said the cool and wary
hunter; “War&ndash;Eagle may not be alone, there may be turkey&ndash;buzzards
with him.”</p>

<p>“If there be a score of vultures,” said Reginald, “I will
follow him without fear—he would not lead us into harm.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” was the guide’s answer; and
again the party resumed their march in silence.</p>

<p>They soon arrived at a place where the forest was less
densely wooded; some of the larger trees appeared to have
been overthrown by a hurricane, and some of the lesser
to have fallen by the axe. Nekimi trotted forward, as if
making for a spot that he recognised, and the Indian recalled
him with the same cry that he had before used, adding, however,
another, and a shriller sound.</p>

<p>The guide shook his head, and muttered something inaudibly
between his teeth, loosening at the same time the huge axe in
his belt, and throwing his long rifle over his arm, ready for
immediate use.</p>

<p>These preparations did not escape the observation of Reginald;
and although he said nothing, he felt more uneasy than
he cared to own; for it struck him that if the guide, who
seemed to have so high an opinion of War&ndash;Eagle, was apprehensive
of treachery or of some unforeseen danger, there
was less ground for his own confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime the Indian walked composedly forward until he
reached the <i>camp</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>,—a pretty spot, sheltered on the windward
side by a laurel thicket, and on the other commanding a view
of the open glade, and of a small stream winding its silent
course towards the river which our party had so lately left.</p>

<p>On a grassy plot, between two venerable trees, the embers
of a smouldering fire sent up the thin blue vapour which rises
from the burning of green wood, several logs of which were
still piled for fuel; while sundry bones and feathers, scattered
at no great distance, gave sufficient evidence of recent feasting.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle glanced hastily around his camp; and leaving
Nekimi to feed at liberty, secured the less tractable horse;
while he was thus employed, the guide whispered in a low
voice, “There are three or four Indians here! I trace their
marks on the grass, and I know it by this fire; it is a war
party—there are no squaws here; Master Reginald, keep
your ears and eyes open, but show no distrust; if he offers a
pipe, all may yet be right.”</p>

<p>Although the guide said this so distinctly that Reginald
heard every syllable, he was to all appearance busily engaged
in throwing some dry sticks on the fire, and easing himself of
the skins and the venison with which he was loaded. The
Indian now took from a hollow in one of the old trees before&ndash;mentioned,
a pipe, the bowl of which was of red sandstone,
and the stick painted and ornamented with stained porcupine
quills; he also drew out a leather bag of <i>kinne&ndash;kinek</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; and
having filled and lighted his pipe, seated himself at a short
distance from the fire, and gravely invited Reginald to sit on his
right, and the guide on his left. As soon as they were seated,
War&ndash;Eagle inhaled a large volume of smoke; and looking
reverently up to the sky, sent forth a long whiff, as an offering
to the Great Spirit; then simply saying, “My brother is
welcome,” he passed the pipe to Reginald, and afterwards to
Baptiste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>For some time they smoked in silence: not a sound was
heard but the crackling of the wood on the fire, and the
occasional chirrup of a robin in the neighbouring bushes. This
silent system not suiting Reginald’s ardent temperament, he
abruptly addressed the Indian as follows:—</p>

<p>“Has my brother come far from his people?”</p>

<p>A cloud gathered on the chief’s brow, and the guide thought
that a storm of wrath would be excited by this unlucky
question; but the Indian, looking steadily upon the frank open
countenance of the speaker, replied, in a voice rather melancholy
than fierce, “War&ndash;Eagle has few people: the bones of
his fathers are <i>not far</i>!”</p>

<p>Our hero, anxious to dismiss a subject which seemed painful
to his new friend, turned the conversation to his equipment,
and observed, “My brother walks abroad without fear; he is
almost without arms.”</p>

<p>The Indian, carelessly resting his hand upon his war&ndash;club,
said (speaking rather to himself, than to his companions), “It
has tasted blood: ask the Dahcotahs!”</p>

<p>“The Dahcotahs are dogs,” said the guide, angrily. “Their
skins are red, but their hearts are white!”</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle, turning upon him a penetrating look, continued,
“Grande&ndash;Hâche is a warrior; he has smoked, has feasted,
has fought among the <i>Lenapé</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>; he has struck more than one
Dahcotah chief. But the Grande&ndash;Hâche cannot rest: the scalp
of his mother hangs in the lodge of the <i>Assiniboins</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; her
spirit is unquiet in the dark hunting&ndash;ground.”</p>

<p>The guide made no reply, but the forced compression of his
lips, and the muscular contraction that passed over his sinewy
frame, showed how deeply he cherished that vengeance which
the Indian’s word awakened.</p>

<p>“This is then,” said our hero to himself, “the cause of that
fierce unextinguishable hate which Baptiste has always borne
to these Sioux; I cannot wonder at it.” Reginald continued,
however, his conversation respecting his new friend’s equipment,
in the same tone: “My brother’s war&ndash;club is strong,
and that iron spike in its head is sharp; but the rifle kills from
far, and the white men are not all friends to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle has ears and eyes; he can see snakes in the
grass,” was the calm reply.</p>

<p>“Nay, but my brother is careless,” said Reginald laughing;
“Grande&ndash;Hâche, as you call him, and I are two men, both
strong and armed with rifles: if we were not his brothers, the
War&ndash;Eagle would be in danger.”</p>

<p>“The bad Spirit made the thick water and the horses too
strong for War&ndash;Eagle,” said the latter, referring to the morning’s
accident, “but he could not be hurt by his brother’s rifle.”</p>

<p>“And why so?” demanded Reginald.</p>

<p>“Because,” said the Indian, “the white warrior has smoked,
has taken his brother’s gift, and the Great Spirit has written
on his face that he cannot speak lies.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my brave friend,” said Reginald (not a
little gratified by the untutored compliment); “but if you
fall in with white men who carry rifles, and who <i>do</i> speak lies—how
fares it with you then?”</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle is always ready,” said he, in the same unmoved
tone; “the Grande&ndash;Hâche is a great warrior—my
brother will take many scalps; yet <i>if</i> their tongues were forked—<i>if</i>
their hearts were bad—both would die where they now
sit—they have neither ears nor eyes—but the Lenapé is a
chief, they are as safe here as in the great white village.”</p>

<p>Though inwardly nettled at this taunt, which he felt to be
not altogether undeserved, the guide took no other notice of it
than to strain to the utmost those organs of sight and hearing
which the red&ndash;skin had held so cheap, but in vain: the forest
around them seemed wrapt in solitude and silence; the eyes of
Reginald, however, served him better on this occasion. “By
heaven, the Indian speaks truth,” said he; “I see them
plainly—one, two, three! and we, Baptiste, are at their
mercy.”</p>

<p>This he spoke in French, and the guide answered in the
same language: “Do you see Indians, Master Reginald, where
I can see naught but trees, and logs, and grass; if it is so—I
am an owl, and no hunter!”</p>

<p>“Glance your eye,” said our hero, calmly, “to yon old fallen
log, that lies fifty or sixty yards to your right, there are three
small parallel lines visible there,—they are three gun&ndash;barrels;
the sun shone on them a minute since, and their muzzles are
directed full upon us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is true; your eyes are younger than mine, I suppose,”
said the guide, apparently more disconcerted at that circumstance
than at the imminent peril of their situation; he added,
in a low, determined tone, “but they must shoot very true, if
they wish to prevent me from taking this deep and deceitful
villain with me on the long journey.”</p>

<p>During the whole of this conversation, War&ndash;Eagle sat in
unmoved silence, occasionally puffing out a whiff from the
fragrant herb in his pipe. Reginald met the unexpected danger
with the straightforward, daring courage which was the characteristic
of his mind; Baptiste with the cool resolution which
was the result of a life of stratagems, perils, and escapes.</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle,” said the former, “you speak true; Grande&ndash;Hâche
and I have shut our eyes and ears; but they are now
open; I see your warriors.”</p>

<p>The Indian turned his searching eye full upon the speaker;
he met a look bold, open, fearless as his own. “Where can
my white brother see warriors?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Their guns are across yonder log,” said Reginald; “and
their muzzles are pointed here.”</p>

<p>“It is so,” said War&ndash;Eagle; “the red men are on the
war&ndash;path; they seek blood; is my white brother not afraid?”</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle is a chief,” replied the young man; “he cannot
lie,—he has said that his white brother is as safe as in
the wigwam of his father!”</p>

<p>Again the Indian bent a scrutinising look upon the countenance
of the speaker, and again met the same smile of fearless
confidence. With more emotion than he had yet shown,
he said, “The Great Spirit has given to my white brother the
big heart of a Lenapé!”</p>

<p>He now made a signal to his ambuscade to come forth, on
which they started up from behind the large fallen tree which
had hitherto screened them, and advanced slowly towards the
camp. They were three in number; two of them active
looking men, of moderate stature, but of symmetrical proportions;
the third a lad, apparently about seventeen years old;
the faces of the two former were painted with black stripes,
which gave them an appearance at once fierce and grotesque;
they were lightly clad in hunting&ndash;shirts, leggins, and mocassins,
all of elk&ndash;skin, and each carried a tomahawk, scalp&ndash;knife, and
the gun before mentioned; the young lad carried no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
weapon but the gun; his hunting&ndash;shirt was fancifully ornamented
with tassels of porcupine quills, and was fastened at
the waist by a belt studded with party&ndash;coloured beads; his
leggins were fringed, and his mocassins were also braided with
the quills of the porcupine; in figure he was slight and tall;
as he drew near, Reginald thought his countenance even more
remarkable than that of War&ndash;Eagle: indeed its beauty would
have been almost effeminate, had it not been for the raven
blackness of the hair, and the piercing fire of the dark eyes.
The three came forward in silence, the lad being rather in advance
of the others, and stood before the War&ndash;Eagle.</p>

<p>He bade them, in his own language, to be seated, and smoke
the pipe with the white men. They did so, with the exception
of the lad, who not being yet a warrior, passed it untouched;
and when it had gone round, War&ndash;Eagle harangued
his party: as he narrated the events of the morning, Reginald
was struck by the deep and flexible modulation of his voice;
and although he did not understand a word of the language,
fancied that he knew when the chief related his immersion and
subsequent preservation by the white man’s knife.</p>

<p>At this portion of the tale, the Indian youth made no attempt
to conceal his emotion; his glistening eyes were fixed
upon the speaker, and every feature of his intelligent countenance
beamed with affectionate interest: as War&ndash;Eagle described
his being struck under water, stunned by a blow from a horse’s
foot, and that the thick water covered him, a hurried exclamation
escaped from the boy’s lips; and when his chief related
how the white warrior had dived, had cut the cord in which
he was entangled, and had brought him again to the air and to
life, the youth, no longer able to control his feelings, threw
himself into Reginald’s arms, exclaiming, in good English,</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit reward the white warrior: he has given
me back my chief—my brother!”</p>

<p>Our hero was no less astonished than was the guide, at such
uncontrolled emotion in a youth of a nation so early taught to
conceal their feelings; nor were they less surprised at the
clearness and purity of accent with which he expressed himself
in English.</p>

<p>“I only did, my boy,” said Reginald, kindly, “what you
would have done had you been in my place.”</p>

<p>“You are a great warrior,” said the youth, running his eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
over the powerful frame beside him: “Wingenund would
have gone into the strong river, and would have died with the
War&ndash;Eagle.”</p>

<p>“Is Wingenund, then, your name, my brave boy?”</p>

<p>“It was my forefather’s name,” said the youth, proudly.
“I have yet no name; but War&ndash;Eagle says I may have one
soon, and I will have no other.”</p>

<p>“I feel sure you will deserve your forefather’s name,” said
Reginald. “What does it mean in my language?”</p>

<p>“It means, ‘The Beloved.’”</p>

<p>“The youth speaks true,” murmured the guide (who,
though busily engaged in rounding off a bullet with his knife,
lost not a word or gesture that passed), “he speaks only truth;
I knew his forefather well: a braver and a better heart never
dwelt among the Lenapé.”</p>

<p>The boy looked gratefully at the weather&ndash;beaten hunter;
and as he cast his eyes down in silence, it would have been
difficult to say whether pleasure, pride, or pain predominated
in their expression.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” resumed Reginald, “how come you to speak
English like a white man?”</p>

<p>“The good father and Olitipa taught me.”</p>

<p>Reginald looked at the guide for an explanation; that worthy
personage shook his head, saying, “The boy talks riddles;
but they are not hard to guess. The good father must be some
missionary, or priest; and Olitipa would in their tongue signify
‘pretty prairie&ndash;fowl;’ so it is probably the name of a Delaware
woman—perhaps his sister.”</p>

<p>“<i>Kehella là</i>—so it is,” said the boy: “Olitipa is in
your tongue ‘pretty prairie&ndash;bird,’ and she is my sister.”</p>

<p>“Where is Prairie&ndash;bird?” inquired Reginald, amused by
the youth’s <i>naïveté</i>.</p>

<p>“Far, far away, beyond the great river! But we will go
back soon;—shall we not?” inquired he, looking up timidly
at War&ndash;Eagle.</p>

<p>“<i>Pechu lenitti</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>” answered the chief; and leaning towards
the youth, he added some words in a whisper, which made
him start up to obey the orders he had received.</p>

<p>Reginald was not long left in ignorance of their nature, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in a few minutes the active lad had refreshed the fire, and was
busy in broiling some venison steaks, which, after the exercise
of the morning, sent up a steam far from unpleasant to the
senses of any of those present.</p>

<p>“Master Reginald,” said the guide, “that silly perroquet
of yours, Gustave Perrot, is always telling fine stories of what
he has seen in Europe, and talking of the scent of roses, and
the sweet sounds of music, till the girls in the clearins think
he’s a book&ndash;author and a poet: did you ever smell any scent,
or hear any music, sweeter than comes from the hissing and
frizzing of those slices of fat venison after a six hours’ hunt
in the woods?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Reginald, laughing; “but we are
only hunters, and Monsieur Perrot is a man of taste.”</p>

<p>“Whom have we here,” grumbled the guide, as an Indian
appeared in the distance. “Friend War&ndash;Eagle, is this another
of your band?”</p>

<p>“He is,” replied the chief: “all are now here.”</p>

<p>The new comer was a powerful, athletic&ndash;looking man: his
face was painted one half black, and the other half striped with
bars of red; the sleeves of his hunting&ndash;shirt were so short
and loose, that his naked arms were visible, one of which was
tatooed in the form of a lizard, and on the other he wore an
armlet of brass; his leggins and mocassins were soiled and
torn, and the perspiration streaming from his matted hair
showed that he had travelled both far and fast. He was,
like the rest, equipped with rifle, tomahawk, and scalp&ndash;knife;
his countenance, as far as it could be distinguished
through its disguise of paint, was expressive of cunning and
ferocity. Though probably much surprised at seeing two
white men sitting thus amicably with his chief, he took little
notice of them, or of the rest of the party; but without asking,
or being asked, any questions, seated himself on the opposite
side of the fire, lighted his pipe, and smoked.</p>

<p>“Master Reginald,” said the guide, in French, “I do not
like that fellow. I know not how he comes to be with our
friend here, for he belongs to another tribe; I have seen him
before.”</p>

<p>Meantime, the industrious lad had broiled his venison
steaks, and having gathered some broad leaves, which served
on this occasion for plates, he brought the first slice to Reginald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the second to Baptiste, the next to War&ndash;Eagle, and so
on, until he went through the party; after which, without
tasting anything himself, he took his station close to his chief
and his new friend. During the meal, the Indian last
arrived talked much in a suppressed voice to the one next to
him, and seemed studiously to avert his eyes from his chief
and the two white men.</p>

<p>“Tarhé,” said War&ndash;Eagle, addressing him, “is there not
<i>tassmanané</i><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> for the stranger? he is my brother, and his
path has been long.”</p>

<p>Tarhé went to his “câche,” a spot not many yards distant,
and taking out two or three small cakes, brought them round
behind his chief, and offered one to our hero, who was in the
act of receiving it, when the miscreant, drawing the knife
from his girdle, aimed a blow at the back of the unsuspecting
Reginald.</p>

<p>Nothing could have saved him from instant death, had not
the gallant boy thrown himself between the savage and his
victim. The knife went through his arm; and so deadly
was the force by which it was guided, that it still descended,
and inflicted a slight scratch on Reginald’s shoulder.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle sprang like a tiger from the ground, and with
one blow of his tremendous war&ndash;club dashed the ruffian to
the earth; then turning suddenly his angry glance upon the two
other Indians, he asked if they had any part in Tarhé’s plot.
Neither had stirred from their seat, and both declared they
had known nothing of his intention. It was well for them
that the chief believed them, for this act of vile treachery had
aroused all the slumbering fire within him, and the veins
started like blue cords upon his temples.</p>

<p>Reginald’s first impulse, when he jumped upon his feet,
was to hasten to the wounded youth, whose features were now
lighted up by a smile of happiness. “Tell me, my brave,
generous boy, are you much hurt?”</p>

<p>“No,” said he, “I should have been hurt if the War&ndash;Eagle’s
camp had been stained with the blood of his white
brother.”</p>

<p>The sturdy guide himself could not repress his admiration
of this gallant boy’s conduct, who now stood looking intently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
upon War&ndash;Eagle, his features animated by excitement and by
pride, and the knife still fixed up to the very handle in his arm,</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle,” said Baptiste, “the Lenapé are men,—their
boys are warriors: that dog is not a Lenapé,” added he,
pointing to the prostrate body of Tarhé.</p>

<p>“<i>Tah&ndash;Delamattenos</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>,” said the chief indignantly. The
youth now moving a step forward, came before his chief with
an air of modest dignity, and slowly drew the reeking knife
from his arm, while a stream of blood gushed from the
wound; not a muscle of his frame trembled, not a feature
varied its expression, as he said, in a voice of musical gentleness,
“War&ndash;Eagle, will Wingenund allow his grandson now
to bear his name?”</p>

<p>“<i>Wingenund!</i>” said War&ndash;Eagle, looking upon him with
affectionate pride, “the chiefs at the Council&ndash;fire shall know
that the blood of the well&ndash;beloved still flows in a young
warrior’s veins.”</p>

<p>“My good friend,” said the guide to the chief, “you have
no time to lose, the lad will bleed to death!”</p>

<p>Reginald sprang forward, and closing as he best could the
gaping wound, bound his handkerchief tightly over it.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, no time to be lost; for the blood had
flowed more freely than his youthful frame could endure. A
painful dizziness came over him; and murmuring, almost
inaudibly, “The White Warrior is safe, and Wingenund is
happy,” he fell senseless into Reginald’s arms.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">CONTAINING SOME PARTICULARS OF THE HISTORY OF THE TWO DELAWARES
AND OF BAPTISTE. THE LATTER RETURNS WITH REGINALD
TO MOOSHANNE, THE RESIDENCE OF COLONEL BRANDON.</p>


<p class="pn">“I fear he will die!” said Reginald, in a tone of the
deepest grief, as he stooped over the inanimate form of the
wounded boy.</p>

<p>“Die!” said the War&ndash;Eagle, almost fiercely; “yes, he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
die! but not by the bite of yonder serpent,” pointing to the
body of the Wyandot: “He will die when the Great Spirit
orders it; but before he dies, the murderers of his father
shall hear his war&ndash;whoop! His tomahawk shall be red in
their blood; their scalps shall hang at his belt! <i>then</i> Wingenund
may go to his ancient people in the happy hunting
fields!”</p>

<p>“My brother,” said Reginald, earnestly, and still supporting
the insensible frame of Wingenund, “do not lead this youth
to shed the white man’s blood! He cannot call back those
who are gone! We have a book which the Great Spirit gave
to our forefathers; it speaks His own words, and He tells us,
‘Vengeance is mine;’ and He also tells us that if we would
please Him, we must forgive those who have injured us: His
arrows are very sharp; His anger is fierce; His justice is sure.
Leave Him to punish those bad men, and teach the ‘well&ndash;beloved’
to be the white man’s friend.”</p>

<p>For a minute the chief seemed buried in deep thought;
then suddenly starting from his reverie, he spoke a few words
in a low tone to one of his men, who instantly moved away,
and disappeared in the forest.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle then replied in a tone rather of melancholy than
of reproof, “The Great Spirit never speaks to the red man
in words: if He is angry, He thunders; if He is pleased, He
sends rain and sunshine, to make the corn and fruits to grow,
and sweet grass to fatten the deer. My brother says the Great
Spirit has spoken plainly to the white man in words, and that
those words are painted in a book. War&ndash;Eagle believes it
because my brother’s tongue is not forked: but he would ask,—Did
those white men, who came in the night like wolves to
the couch of the fawn, who murdered the father, the kindred,
the little sisters of Wingenund,—did those men hear the
Great Spirit’s words?”</p>

<p>“My brother,” said Reginald, “there are among white men
many wolves and serpents: men whose hands are bloody, and
their tongue forked. The Great Spirit does not forbid to
punish, or even to kill such men, in defence of ourselves, our
wigwams, our children, or our friend. He is not angry with
War&ndash;Eagle for striking down that Huron whose hand was
raised to shed his brother’s blood; but when the grass of many
seasons has grown over the graves of those who were injured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
then the Great Spirit commands man to let his anger sleep, to
bury his hatchet, and to forgive.”</p>

<p>“It may be so,” said War&ndash;Eagle, gravely; “the Good
Father in the Western Hunting&ndash;ground has said the same;
Olitipa, whose voice is like the mockingbird, and who speaks
only truth, she has spoken the same; but it is very dark,
War&ndash;Eagle cannot see it.”</p>

<p>“Who is the Prairie&ndash;bird?” inquired Reginald, whose
curiosity had twice been excited by the mention of this extraordinary
name.</p>

<p>Before the chief could reply, the Indian, whom he had sent,
returned with a mess made from several leaves, herbs, and
roots, which he had bruised and reduced to a kind of glutinous
pulp. War&ndash;Eagle now took off the bandage from the youth’s
arm: after examining it carefully, and applying some of the
above mixture to both the orifices of the wound, he bound it
again, more strongly and skilfully than before; then taking
him in his arms, as if he had been a little child, he carried
him down to the rivulet; and by dint of bathing his temples
and rubbing forcibly his hands and feet, soon restored the
suspended animation.</p>

<p>When he was recovered so far as to be able to speak,
Reginald, sitting down by him, said a thousand kind things
to him, such as were prompted by the gratitude of a generous
heart.</p>

<p>While they were conversing, the guide drew near to the
chief; and pointing to the body of the Wyandot, which still
lay where he had fallen, said, “He is surely dead!”</p>

<p>“He is so,” replied the other, gravely; “when War&ndash;Eagle
is angry he does not strike his enemy’s forehead twice.”</p>

<p>The guide now turned over the body; and seeing that the
iron point of the war&ndash;club had entered just above the eyes,
and had sunk deep into the brain, he knew that instant death
must have ensued. The chief calling the two Indians, desired
them to bury the body where it would be safe from wolves and
buzzards. “But,” he added, sternly, “let not the spot be
marked for his kindred: he died like a dog, and none should
lament him.”</p>

<p>As they turned away to execute these orders, the guide
observed to the chief “that Huron has not been long with the
War&ndash;Eagle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“True,—but how does the Grande&ndash;Hâche know it?”</p>

<p>“His eye has been on him more than once; Grande&ndash;Hâche
sees, but he can hold his tongue.”</p>

<p>“Grande&ndash;Hâche is a warrior,” replied the chief: “he has
seen many things; he has talked with the wise men; does he
know why yon Huron wished to kill the young white brave?”</p>

<p>“He does,” said Grande&ndash;Hâche; but as he did not of himself
state what he knew, it would have been contrary to the
usages of Indian courtesy to have questioned him further.</p>

<p>Baptiste now diverting the conversation to another topic,
said, “It is singular that War&ndash;Eagle, on a war&ndash;path far from
his village, should have only strangers with him excepting the
youth who is wounded!”</p>

<p>“What means the Grande&ndash;Hâche?”</p>

<p>“He means,” replied the guide, “that the other two, now
gone to bury the Huron, are <i>Southern men</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>—they are not
Lenapé.”</p>

<p>“Grande&ndash;Hâche has ears and eyes open—how can he know
that he speaks truth?” said the chief.</p>

<p>“Because he <i>has</i> eyes and ears;” replied the guide.
“Does War&ndash;Eagle think that Grande&ndash;Hâche has hunted twenty
years among the red nations, and knows not yet the mocassin
and tongue of a Shawanon? I knew them at a glance,”
added he, with shrewd smile, “as well as I knew the War&ndash;Eagle
in the batteau, though both he and they have put on
their faces the paint of the <i>Mengwe</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>“Grande&ndash;Hâche speaks truth,” replied the chief dryly,
without showing the surprise and annoyance that he felt at the
penetration of the guide. “The men are Shawanons, they
hunt with the Lenapé, beyond the great river—they are
brothers.”</p>

<p>So saying, he broke off the conversation, and turning
towards Wingenund, saw that he was talking as earnestly and
freely with Reginald as if they had been long intimate; while
he contemplated this friendly intercourse with a smile of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
satisfaction, the guide felt himself called upon to remind his
companion that the sun was getting low, that they had yet
some miles to walk, and that the Colonel would be anxious and
impatient.</p>

<p>“True,” said Reginald, springing up, “I must take leave
of my brother, and of my young preserver; but we shall
meet again; we will hunt together, and be friends.”</p>

<p>“Let it be so,” said the lad, with an ardour which he cared
not to conceal; “and Wingenund will tell Prairie&ndash;bird that
the white warrior who drew War&ndash;Eagle from the deep water
will come to see her, and she will thank him.”</p>

<p>While the boy was speaking, the chief turned away, and
busied himself in fastening a thong halter firmly to the head of
Nekimi, whom he again led to his new master.</p>

<p>Reginald now undid from his waist the silver buckled belt
with the couteau&ndash;de&ndash;chasse which it supported, and buckling
it round the youth, he said, “Wingenund must wear this, and
must not forget his white friend.”</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, as he received this
gift; but he was still too weak to stand, and he only murmured,
in a low voice, “Wingenund will not forget.”</p>

<p>The chief now taking the guide aside said to him, in his
own language, “How is my white brother called?”</p>

<p>“I call him ‘Master Reginald.’”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>After one or two ludicrous attempts at an imitation, War&ndash;Eagle
shook his head, saying, “It is not good—may his
Lenapé friend call him ‘Netis?’”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>As soon as Reginald was informed of what had passed, and
of the meaning of his new name, he accepted it with pleasure,
and Wingenund repeated it again and again as our hero bid
him farewell.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle insisted upon accompanying him, and leading
Nekimi through the forest, until they reached the broad wheel
track which passed Colonel Brandon’s house, and thence led
through other clearings to the village of Marietta. As they
went along, Reginald desired Baptiste in a whisper to talk
with the chief, and endeavour to draw from him what article
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>of dress, ornament or use, he would most value, as he was
anxious to make his Indian brother a present; and the guide,
by skilfully man&oelig;uvring his conversation, soon learnt that
War&ndash;Eagle had, on this last excursion, lost his rifle, and that
he was also short of ammunition. They now emerged from
the forest upon the great road, if it might be so called, leading
to Marietta; and the Indian putting the halter of Nekimi into
Reginald’s hand, said that he would return to his camp. Our
hero, taking him by the hand, said, “Netis wishes to see his
brother at this spot to&ndash;morrow at noon.”</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle will come,” was the brief reply; and shaking
both the white men cordially by the hand, he turned and disappeared
among the trees.</p>

<p>Reginald and the guide were within a few miles of Colonel
Brandon’s house; but they could not proceed very fast, owing
to the evident reluctance shown by Nekimi to follow his new
master; he neighed, snorted, jumped, and played all manner
of pranks in his endeavour to get loose; but this War&ndash;Eagle
had foreseen, and the tough halter of undressed hide was well
enough secured to defy all his efforts at escape.</p>

<p>“This has been a strange day of adventures, Baptiste,”
said Reginald; “it has been to me one of the pleasantest of
my life!”</p>

<p>“Why, Master Reginald, it has been a day of events, such
as they are; you have been twice at the outside edge of t’other
world, with water and cold iron.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there was not much harm in the water,” said Reginald,
laughing; “had it not been for the knock which one
of the horses gave me on the head; but that villainous attempt
of the Huron makes me shudder;—to offer a man food, and
stab him while he is taking it! I thought such a thing was
unknown in Indian history.”</p>

<p>“It is almost,” said the guide. “But a Huron—and a
Dahcotah!” added he, bitterly—“would murder a brother
to gratify revenge.”</p>

<p>“But I had never injured him, Baptiste.”</p>

<p>“His memory is better than yours, Master Reginald. He
and his brother were two of the leading warriors in that unfortunate
affair where St. Clair was beat by the Ingians, upon
the north fork of the Miami. I was there, too, and the
‘Doctor’s’ pills did some service—but not much to signify,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
neither. Colonel Brandon did all that man could do, but at
last he was forced back. Well, that Tarhé and his brother,
first in the pursuit, killed two of our poor fellows, and were
scalping ‘em, when the Colonel called out to ‘em, and fired.
He killed Tarhé’s brother dead. I see’d it all; and I took a
long squint with the Doctor at Tarhé, which only lamed his
arm a bit; for, you see, Master Reginald, I was a long ways
off; and a chap don’t shoot quite so fine when he’s a retreatin’
double&ndash;quick, with a few hundred red&ndash;skins yellin’ in his rear.
However, that Tarhé has been more than once down at Marietta,
and round the neighbours’ clearins; and he knowed you,
Master Reginald, just as well as a Kentucky hog knows an
acorn.”</p>

<p>“Now I understand it, so far, Baptiste. But if the fellow
wanted to take my life, why did he not hide in the laurel&ndash;thicket,
and shoot me as I passed? Why did he make the
attempt where my death was sure to be revenged?”</p>

<p>“Now, Master Reginald, you are asking a poor ignorant
crittur,—who knows nought but a little huntin’, and, may be,
knows a beaver&ndash;skin from a buffalo&ndash;hide,—all the ins and
outs of a red Ingian’s crooked mind! May be, he wanted to
force War&ndash;Eagle into shedding white man’s blood. I saw
that one of those Shawanons was up to his game; and if a
general skrimmage had come, they’d have tried to do for me.
Or, perhaps, when he found his knife so convenient to the
back of your neck, he couldn’t lose the chance, for the bad
spirit had got hold of him.”</p>

<p>“By heavens!” cried Reginald, “I never can sufficiently
admire the quickness, and the heroic courage of that boy,
Wingenund! Did you see, Baptiste, how he drew that great
knife <i>slowly</i> out of his wounded arm; and how all the time he
smiled upon War&ndash;Eagle, as if to show him that he despised
the pain?”</p>

<p>“He is a brave youth,” said the guide. “I know the stock
he comes from: if he were a coward, the grisly bear might
breed sheep!”</p>

<p>“Pray tell me something of his parents, and of his story.
Is he related to War&ndash;Eagle?”</p>

<p>“He is,” said the guide. “They are the children of two
brothers. War&ndash;Eagle of the eldest; Wingenund of the
youngest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are these two brothers alive, Baptiste?”</p>

<p>“No: both were murdered by the white men, in time of
peace, without provocation. There was a third brother, who,
happening to be absent from the village on a hunt, escaped.
He has now gone to the far west, beyond the great river.
Both the War&ndash;Eagle and the boy are called his sons; and the
latter, as he told us to&ndash;day, lives in his lodge.”</p>

<p>“Then all these three brothers were the children of
Wingenund?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And who was he?”</p>

<p>“One of the old Lenapé:—first in council, and foremost
in the fight! I remember him well when I was a boy,” said
the guide, warming with his subject. “He taught me to
follow a trail, and to travel in the woods, with no other guide
than the wind, the stars, and the bark of the trees; and before
I was as old as that boy, his grandson, he lent me his rifle to
shoot the first Dahcotah as ever I killed.”</p>

<p>“What was the party, Baptiste?” said Reginald (anxious
to keep the guide from the subject of the Dahcotahs), “what
party was it that committed the atrocious murder upon the
Indians in time of peace?”</p>

<p>“Why, Master Reginald, though you were but a youngster,
don’t you remember hearing that twelve or fourteen years ago
a party of white men, led by Williamson, Harvey, and some
other rough chaps from the Kentucky side, fell upon a village
of friendly Indians on the banks of Tuscarawas river, and
murdered all they found—man, woman, and child? Some of
these poor red&ndash;skins had been made Christians, and were called
Moravians; and their village as was destroyed was called by
some outlandish name, too long by half for me to speak or to
remember.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> They had given over their own nat’ral life of
smoking, hunting, and fighting, and did nothing but plant,
and sow, and pray! And, after all, that’s the way they was
served, Master Reginald!”</p>

<p>“Horrible and disgraceful cruelty!” said the young man:
and rather thinking aloud, than addressing his companion, he
added, “It is no wonder that the Indians should receive so
unwillingly Christian precepts, when they have such examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of Christian practice. I am not surprised that War&ndash;Eagle
should find it hard to forgive <i>such</i> injuries.”</p>

<p>“And yet you are surprised, Master Reginald,” said the
guide, in a deep voice, almost hoarse from repressed emotion,
“that <i>I</i> do not forgive the Dahcotah? Did he not burn the
log&ndash;hut where I was born and raised? Did he not murder
those who gave me birth? Did he not drive me out, a child,
into the woods, to live by berries, or wild fruits, or what I could
find or kill? Is not my father’s scalp (not half revenged!)
now hanging before a Dahcotah lodge! Oh! let me come
but within rifle range of the throat&ndash;cutter,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and if he comes
off with a whole skin, I <i>will</i> forgive him!”</p>

<p>Our hero, seeing that further discussion would only increase
an excitement which already mastered his companion’s self&ndash;control,
said to him kindly, “Well, Baptiste, it must be owned
that you have received from these people deep, irreparable
wrong! You are a man, and would not pay them in their
own base coin, by killing one of their squaws or children:
but if it is ever your fortune to meet them in a fair stand&ndash;up
fight, when I am with you, then you shall see that I can stand
by a friend, and share in his just feelings of resentment.”</p>

<p>“I know it—I know it, Master Reginald,” said the guide,
grasping the hand extended to him; and having now recovered
an equanimity which nothing but the Dahcotah subject ever
disturbed, he added,</p>

<p>“If you and I were to take a summer&ndash;hunt towards the
mountains, with that light&ndash;limbed War&ndash;Eagle, who has the
eyes, and ears, and the spring of a painter<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, we might p’raps
bring in a handsome load o’ skins, and may be, pay off the
throat&ndash;cutters an old debt or two.”</p>

<p>“It is more likely than you imagine, Baptiste, that we
should make an excursion to the West this spring; for my
father told me the other day—but see, there he is, with Lucy
on his arm, and Aunt Mary, and Wolf by her side!”</p>

<p>As he said this, the young man bounded forward, and in a
moment was in the midst of them, kissing his sister, shaking
his father and Aunt Mary affectionately by the hand, and
patting Wolf’s great shaggy head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear Reginald! what has kept you so long?” said Lucy,
reproachfully; “where can you have been? Why, your
clothes are all soiled; and see, papa,” she added, turning
deadly pale; “there is blood upon his hunting&ndash;shirt and
upon his cheek!”</p>

<p>“What a little coward art thou,” said Reginald, “to be
the daughter of a soldier! Why, Lucy, the few drops of
blood upon my clothes must surely have come from your
cheeks, which are as pale as a magnolia flower! Harkee,
Lucy, I must do something to drive the rosy current back to
its proper channel; come here, girl:” and bending her head
aside, he whispered something in her ear.</p>

<p>Never was the effect of magic more rapid, or more potent;
for in an instant the obedient blood rushed to the fair girl’s
cheek, suffusing at the same time her neck and temples with
the same glowing hue: casting upon her brother a look at
once playful and appealing, she pinched his ear between her
tiny fingers till he fairly begged pardon, and promised not to
do so again.</p>

<p>As it was now evident that Reginald was not much hurt, Lucy
turned her eyes towards the hunter, who approached, leading
Nekimi still snorting, prancing, and curvetting at the full
length of his laryette. “Baptiste,” said the Colonel, “where
have you found that wild, untamed animal?”</p>

<p>“He belongs,” said the hunter, “to Master Reginald.”</p>

<p>The Colonel looked to his son for an explanation, who
giving an arm to his sister, while the Colonel escorted Aunt
Mary, turned homewards, and narrated, as they went, the
events described in this and the foregoing chapter.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">CONTAINING A SKETCH OF MOOSHANNE.—REGINALD INTRODUCES HIS
SISTER TO THE TWO DELAWARES.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> day following that on which the events related in the
preceding pages occurred there was an assemblage more than
usually numerous, gathered in and around the capacious store
of David Muir, in Marietta: immediately in front of his
door was a small party, who, from their bearing and appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
might be easily recognised as leading persons in the little
community. In the midst of them was a roughly&ndash;dressed
country lad, whose haggard appearance indicated wretchedness
or fatigue, or both: near the group stood his horse, reeking
with sweat, and showing that the messenger, for such he
was, had not spared the spurs on the road. Many and eager
were the questions put to him; and the countenances of his
auditors evinced no ordinary degree of interest in his replies;
several women, and a dozen or two of boys and girls, made
repeated endeavours to penetrate into this important circle;
and having contrived to overhear a disjointed word, here and
there, such as “Indian,” “scalped,” “rifle,” &amp;c. they slunk
away, one by one, to spread it abroad through the village,
that a neighbouring settlement had been attacked by a large
body of Indians, armed with rifles and tomahawks; and that
every man, woman, and child, excepting this messenger, who
had escaped, was scalped!</p>

<p>We will, however, introduce the reader into the centre of
the above&ndash;mentioned group, and detail to him the substance of
the news which created so much excitement.</p>

<p>It appears that on the preceding day, two brothers, named
Hervey, were riding homeward after attending a marriage,
at a small settlement twenty miles to the northward of Marietta:
they were not above half a mile in advance of several other
men, also returning from the marriage; both were armed
with rifles, having been shooting at a target for a wager, when
on a sudden, a single Indian, uttering a loud war&ndash;whoop,
sprang from a thicket by the road, and at one stroke of his
war&ndash;club felled the elder brother to the earth; before the
second could come up to his assistance, the same Indian aimed
a sweeping blow at his head with the butt&ndash;end of his rifle;
the younger Hervey warded the blow also with his rifle, but it
fell with such force that both barrels were broken off from the
stocks: with the rapidity of lightning, the Indian struck him
heavily on the head, and he fell stunned from his horse. A
few minutes afterwards, he recovered, and found some of his
friends standing over him; his unfortunate brother lay dead
and scalped at his side: his horse and the Indian had disappeared.
Several young men dashed off immediately in
pursuit, and tracked the hoofs successfully until the fugitive
had entered the hardy and stony bed of a rivulet falling into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the Muskingum; hence all further search proved unsuccessful,
and they returned dispirited to their companions.</p>

<p>It was long since so daring an outrage had been committed
in the territory; seldom was it that the red&ndash;skins would attack
white men in open day, unless they were greatly superior in
numbers; but for a single Indian to fall upon two armed
whites, killing one and leaving the other for dead, almost within
call of his friends, was an instance of audacity to which the
oldest hunter could scarcely remember a parallel: it was
evident also that the savage had been aware of a party of
whites being at hand, otherwise he would certainly have shot
one brother before he attacked the other; but, avoiding the
discharge of his rifle, he had effected his purpose with a
war&ndash;club.</p>

<p>Another striking circumstance was the clear evidence afforded
that the killing of the elder Hervey was an act of personal
revenge; because the younger brother when knocked from his
horse had fallen helpless at the Indian’s feet; and the latter,
purposely to show that he had spared his life and scalp, had
struck a knife through the lappet of his coat into the ground,
with force enough to bury it up to the haft. Four or five of
the best hunters had recommenced the pursuit; and although
they once struck the trail of a man on foot evidently running
from them, they were again baffled by the river, and returned
to the settlement.</p>

<p>Such was the sum of the messenger’s intelligence, which
caused, as can easily be imagined, no little sensation in Marietta
and the neighbouring districts.</p>

<p>“I know some of the worst o’ them red&ndash;skin devils,” said
a bulky young man, whose countenance betrayed violent
passions, and strong symptoms of free indulgence in David
Muir’s “fire&ndash;water;” “tell me what was this Ingian like?—how
did Dick Hervey describe him?”</p>

<p>“He hadn’t over much time to look at him,” said the
messenger, “afore he was sent to sleep; but he says he was a
very tall powerful chap, streaked over the face with black.”</p>

<p>“Was he a young un or an old un?”</p>

<p>“A young un, and active as a deer, or he couldn’t have
knocked those two Herveys off their critturs, as a man knocks
off a corncob with an ash plant.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had him here,” said the young giant, shutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a hand as heavy and large as a shoulder of mutton. “I’d
give him a real Kentucky hug.”</p>

<p>None of the bystanders seemed able to form any guess as to
who the perpetrator of this bold outrage might be. It was
resolved, however, to take all possible measures for his discovery;
a meeting of the principal inhabitants was convened,
a description of the Indian’s person, and of the marks by
which Hervey’s horse might be recognised, was written, and
several copies thereof made, and forwarded to the nearest
posts and ferries; at the same time a reward of a hundred
dollars was offered to any person who should discover the
offender, and a hundred more for his seizure, dead or alive.</p>

<p>During the discussion of these and other plans at the meeting,
our old acquaintance David Muir, who felt himself not to
be one of the least important persons present, said, “I’m
thinking, gentlemen, it would be as weel to send a messenger
out to Colonel Brandon, wi’ this intelligence; he kens the
Indians as weel’s ony man in this country side, mayhap he’ll
gie us some gude counsel; and, sirs,” added David, his grey
eyes twinkling at his own sagacity, “be sure ye dinna forget
to tak the advice o’ yon lang&ndash;headed chiel, Battiste; if the
Indian deevil’s o’ this side the Mississippi, Battiste will fin’
him out, as sure as twa threes mak sax.”</p>

<p>This was one of the longest orations which David had ever
delivered in public; and both his suggestions being approved,
carried <i>nem. con.</i>, and the meeting dissolved, David returned
to his store with his hands thrust into his coat&ndash;tail pockets, and
his countenance big with the consciousness of having rendered
essential service to the territory.</p>

<p>We must now return to Reginald, who, on the morning of
this same day, rose with the sun; and feeling himself nothing
the worse from his slight wounds, or from his diving adventure,
sallied forth to see how Baptiste had provided for Nekimi’s
safety and comfort. All means having failed to entice him
into a stable, the hunter had secured him firmly to an oak,
casting down for him abundance both of food and litter. Reginald
approached him, holding in his hand some bread; and
having given the sharp shrill cry (which to Lucy’s great alarm
he had practised more than once in the house), he was agreeably
surprised to perceive that the horse recognised it, and seemed
less averse to his caresses. Having fed him, and carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
observed all the rules laid down by War&ndash;Eagle for gaining his
affections, he returned to the house, and began to collect the
various articles which he proposed to give to his Indian
brother; among these was a good Kentucky rifle, and a handsome
buck’s&ndash;horn knife for the chief; he selected also a light
fowling&ndash;piece, which he had used as a boy, and which he
intended for Wingenund; to these he added several pounds of
powder, and a due proportion of lead; he also threw into the
package a few beads and a large cornelian ring, which had
been long the occupant of his dressing&ndash;case.</p>

<p>When he had collected all these together, he gave them to
Baptiste, desiring him to be ready to accompany him to the
rendezvous after breakfast; and having finished his preparations,
he knocked at the door of Lucy’s room, to inquire
whether she was ready to preside at the morning meal.</p>

<p>“Come in, Reginald,” she said; “if I am rather late it is
your fault; for your adventures of yesterday have driven sleep
from my pillow; and even when I did fall asleep, I dreamt of
nothing but your Indian hero.”</p>

<p>“Say you so, faithless one?”  replied Reginald; “I shall
tell that to——“</p>

<p>“Hush, now, Reginald,” said the blushing girl, putting her
little hand upon his mouth; “did you not promise me yesterday
that you would not do so again?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I did,” said her brother; “and I will keep it if
you will come down stairs and give me a very good cup of
coffee.”</p>

<p>In the breakfast&ndash;room they were joined by the Colonel and
Aunt Mary; and while they discuss that most comfortable of
family meals, we will give the reader a slight sketch of the
house in which they were assembled.</p>

<p>It was built of substantial brick of a dun red colour, and
had originally been a regular and solid building of moderate
dimensions; but the Colonel had added on one side a wing,
containing a library and sitting&ndash;rooms for himself and his son,
while on the opposite side he had built additional apartments
for Aunt Mary, and a small conservatory for Lucy. Thus
the building had gradually assumed a straggling and irregular
shape, the back court being occupied by stables, barns, and
extensive farm offices. The site of the house was on a gentle
elevation, sloping down to a little brook, which wound its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
bubbling way through a deep grove of oak, maple, and sycamore,
and circling round the base of the hill, fell at the distance
of half a mile into the Muskingum river. The spot
still retained the name of “Mooshanne” (signifying, in the
Delaware language, Elk Creek), probably owing to the little
streamlet above mentioned having been a favourite resort of an
animal which the rifles of Reginald and Baptiste had rendered
somewhat scarce in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>We left the family assembled at the breakfast&ndash;table, where
the conversation still turned upon the adventures of the preceding
day.</p>

<p>“Reginald,” said Lucy, “I should like to go with you to&ndash;day,
to see your Indian brother, and that heroic boy.”</p>

<p>“I fear,” replied her brother, “it is farther than you could
easily walk; and, moreover, Wingenund will scarcely accompany
his chief; he must be still too weak from his wound.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Reginald; if the distance is the only difficulty, I
can ride Snowdrop; and if Wingenund does come, I will
reward him for his brave defence of my brother, by giving
him some little trinket, which he may take back to his sister.
You cannot refuse me now,” added she, in a coaxing tone, the
power of which over her brother was all but despotic.</p>

<p>“Of course I cannot, if you obtain Aunt Mary’s and the
Colonel’s permission,” said Reginald, smiling.</p>

<p>Lucy met with no further opposition. Snowdrop was
ordered to be saddled: in a few minutes the happy girl was
equipped, and provided with a coral necklace for the chief, and
a pretty brooch, destined for her brother’s preserver.</p>

<p>The party now assembled before the door, consisting of Reginald,
Baptiste, and Lucy, mounted on her favourite grey
pony: our hero slung his rifle across his shoulders; the sturdy
woodsman, besides carrying his own enormous axe, walked
lightly under the two rifles and the other articles to be presented
to the chief, and Wolf played around them his fantastic
and unwieldy gambols.</p>

<p>Cheerful and smiling was the woodland scenery through
which they passed; the dew&ndash;drops still glittered in the beams
of the morning sun, and the air was impregnated with the
vernal fragrance arising from a thousand opening buds and
blossoms.</p>

<p>“See, Lucy,” said her brother, as he walked by her side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
while the tact of the sturdy hunter kept him a few paces in
the rear, “see how those mischievous squirrels hop and chatter
upon the boughs! They seem to know that your presence is
a protection to them.”</p>

<p>“I often wonder, Reginald, how you can shoot such playful
and graceful animals; you, who have taste enough to admire
their beauty, and who can find sport more worthy of your
rifle.”</p>

<p>“It is childish sport, Lucy; yet they are no contemptible
additions to the table; their furs are useful; and there is some
skill in shooting them, that is, in shooting them properly.”</p>

<p>“If I were a man, I would shoot nothing but lions and
tigers, buffaloes or bears!” said his sister.</p>

<p>“A pretty Amazon, truly!” said Reginald, laughing:
“yet, methinks your thoughts are not always so warlike.
Come, Lucy, now that we are alone (for our good Baptiste is
out of ear&ndash;shot), you need not pout or blush if I ask you
whether Ethelston is expected soon to return?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I know not, Reginald,” said his sister, blushing,
in spite of his prohibition. “His last letter to the Colonel
mentioned something about privateers and the rupture with
France. Papa did not appear desirous of communicating
much upon the subject, so I dropt it.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Reginald; “the French will not soon forget
or forgive the loss of their fine frigate, The Insurgente, which
was taken the other day so gallantly by The Constellation. I
doubt not they will endeavour to cripple our trade in the
West Indies. Edward has got a little craft that can run, if
she cannot fight.”</p>

<p>“I am sure Edward will never run if it is possible to fight,”
said Lucy, a little piqued.</p>

<p>“There, again, you speak the truth: it is because his courage
is so tempered by his judgment, that he is fit to be entrusted
with other lives and property than his own: if it is
<i>not</i> possible to fight, he will have sense and skill enough to
show the Frenchman his heels.—By&ndash;the&ndash;by, Lucy, which
vessel is he now commanding?”</p>

<p>Again there was a decided blush, and almost a pout on
Lucy’s full lip, as she said, “You know, brother, that The
Adventure and the Pocahuntas are both in port, and the
vessel he is now on board of is the—“</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>—“Oh! I remember,” said Reginald, laughing; “she
was to have been called the ‘Lucy;’ but Edward did not
choose to hear that name in every common sailor’s and negro’s
mouth; so he altered it to The Pride of Ohio, which means,
in his vocabulary, the same thing.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” said Lucy, “there was any Mary, or Charlotte,
or Catherine, or any other name under the sun, about
which I could tease you! Have a little patience, Mr. Reginald;
my turn will come; you shall see what mercy I will
show you then!”</p>

<p>Thus did the brother and sister spar and jest with each
other until they reached the spot appointed for the interview.
As they had arrived rather before the time, they imagined that
the War&ndash;Eagle had not yet come; but Baptiste, putting his
finger to his mouth, blew a long shrill signal whistle, and in a
few minutes the chief appeared, accompanied by Wingenund.
As they emerged from the forest, and approached, Reginald
looked at his sister to see the effect produced by their appearance;
for the chief was dressed in a manner calculated to display
his noble figure and countenance to better advantage than
on the preceding day. His long black hair was parted on his
forehead, and gathered into a mass, confined by a narrow fillet
made from the fur of the white weasel, and surmounted by an
eagle’s feather. It seemed that his vow of war and revenge
was for the time cancelled; for the lines of black paint which
had disfigured his visage were removed, and the commanding
form and features were not marred by any grotesque or fanciful
attire. His brawny neck was bare, and a portion of his
bold, open chest appeared beneath the light hunting&ndash;shirt,
which was his only upper vesture. The ponderous war&ndash;club
was still at his girdle, but the scalp had disappeared; and his
light, free step upon the grass was like that of a young elk on
the prairie.</p>

<p>The dress of Wingenund was unaltered. He was still very
weak from the loss of blood, and the pain consequent upon his
wound; his arm rested in a sling, made from the plaited bark
of elm: and the air of languor cast over his countenance by
sleeplessness and suffering, gave additional effect to the delicacy
of his features, and the deep dark lustre of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Our new brother is indeed a fine looking creature!” said
Lucy, as War&ndash;Eagle drew near. “What a haughty step and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
bearing he has! Wingenund looks too gentle to be an
Indian!”</p>

<p>“He is as brave as gentle, Lucy: look at his arm!” and,
as she did look at the wounded limb, she remembered that
only yesterday it had saved her brother’s life.</p>

<p>The greeting between Reginald and the two Indians was
affectionate and cordial: he then presented his sister to them
both in turn. The chieftain placing his hand upon his heart,
fixed upon her that penetrating look with which he had before
scrutinised her brother: it was not the bold stare of vulgarity
admiring beauty, but the child of nature reading, after his own
fashion, a page in her book.</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle,” said Lucy to him, in her own gentle tone
of voice, “I know all that passed yesterday, and you are now
my brother!”</p>

<p>As she pronounced his name in English, a gleam shot
from his eye, and a perceptible and sudden change came over
his countenance: it seemed produced by some unexpected association;
and Lucy was surprised at the deep pathos of his
voice, as he replied, “The Great Spirit has made the sun to
shine upon my white brother’s path! His heart is brave;
his arm is strong; and his sister is like a flower of the
prairie!—her voice comes upon the ear like a pleasant
dream!” These last words he spoke rather to himself than
addressing those around him.</p>

<p>Lucy was not displeased with the Indian’s compliment, and
was about to speak to Wingenund, when Reginald said aloud,
“Come, let us withdraw among those thick trees; we have
many things to talk about.” His proposal being assented to,
the whole party were soon re&ndash;assembled under a branching oak,
screened from the public track by a thicket of rhododendron.</p>

<p>While they were effecting this man&oelig;uvre, the guide took
an opportunity of interchanging a few sentences with the
War&ndash;Eagle; the result of which was apparently satisfactory
to the honest woodsman, for his face instantly resumed its
usual frank and careless expression.</p>

<p>“Lucy,” said her brother, “as you have thought proper to
accompany me here, you must play your part as Queen of the
Feast. I hope my brothers will value these baubles more from
your hands than from mine.” Thus instructed, Lucy opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the canvasss package, which the guide had hitherto carried,
and presenting the large rifle to the chief, she said to him:</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle, your brother and your white sister give you
this rifle, as a mark of their friendship; and with it they give
you powder and lead enough to shoot all the deer and bears in
the territory.”</p>

<p>The chief placed her hand and her brother’s both upon his
heart, saying, “War&ndash;Eagle thanks you. May the Great Spirit
love you, and guard your path!”</p>

<p>He then poised and examined the rifle, which was a piece
of no ordinary beauty and excellence; while Baptiste whispered
to him, in his own language, “It is loaded.”</p>

<p>Lucy then turned to Wingenund, and, presenting him with
the lighter fowling&ndash;piece, said to him, “With this, a sister
thanks Wingenund for a brother’s life.”</p>

<p>The boy cast his eyes modestly to the ground, saying,
“Wingenund is too happy. War&ndash;Eagle will tell his name to
the braves in council. The sister of Netis is good to him;
Wingenund is ready to die!”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Lucy to the guide, “I fear he is very
faint and ill; ask the chief how he passed the night!”</p>

<p>“Wingenund is not ill,” said the boy, with a smile; “he
is very happy.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Baptiste, having conferred with the chief, replied,
“Why, Miss Lucy, the wound was a very bad ‘un, and
he lost a power o’ blood; once or twice in the night, War&ndash;Eagle
thought he might not get over it; but he is better now,
and though unable to bear much fatigue, he is a hardy
young plant, and will take as much killing as an eel.”</p>

<p>“Come, Baptiste,” said Reginald; “I know you put something
to eat and drink into that sack with the ammunition:
War&ndash;Eagle must feast with us to&ndash;day.”</p>

<p>The guide opening his capacious wallet, drew from it a
venison pasty, some bread, and a couple of bottles of Madeira.
Lucy declined taking more than a crust of bread, merely tasting
the wine to the health of the hunters. Wingenund was equally
abstemious, and sat a little apart with his new sister; while
Reginald, Baptiste, and the Chief made a more substantial luncheon.
The latter being asked, by Reginald, how he liked
the wine, replied carelessly, “Good.” But it was evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that he drank it rather from courtesy than because it pleased
his palate.</p>

<p>Reginald now desired the guide to speak to the War&ndash;Eagle
in his own tongue, and to gather from him all the requisite
particulars for his joining the Delawares in their summer&ndash;hunt
beyond the Mississippi. He had long been anxious to visit
some of those scenes which Baptiste had so often described;
and his father having expressed a wish that he should go to
St. Louis on some business connected with his investments in
the fur&ndash;trade, he thought that so fair an opportunity ought
not to be lost.</p>

<p>While the guide and the chief conversed in a low and earnest
tone of voice, and Reginald listened with an idle curiosity,
imagining now and then that he could catch their meaning,
Lucy became much interested in her conversation with Wingenund:
she was surprised at his intelligence, and proficiency
in English, and was touched by the melancholy expression of
his countenance and of his deep lustrous eyes. As she was
speaking, he suddenly and impressively placed his finger on
her arm, then raised it to his own lips, as a sign to her to be
silent; then creeping two or three yards from the party, he
threw himself full length upon the grass with his ear to the
ground. Lucy listened attentively, but could hear nothing
but the gentle breeze stirring the leaves, and the regular
sound of Snowdrop’s teeth as he nibbled the young grass.</p>

<p>The three hunters were still busy with their arrangements
for the summer, when Wingenund, resuming his sitting posture,
uttered an almost imperceptible sound, like the hiss of a small
serpent. Instantly, as if by instinct, the War&ndash;Eagle grasped
his rifle, and looked inquiringly on the intelligent countenance
of the boy.</p>

<p>“Wingenund hears men and horses,” was the short reply.</p>

<p>Baptiste strained his practised ears to the utmost, as did
Reginald, without success. Even War&ndash;Eagle seemed for a
moment unable to catch the sound. He then whispered to
Reginald, “Wingenund speaks truth, there are men—not a
few.”</p>

<p>Several minutes elapsed before our hero and the guide could
distinguish the tramp of horses and the voices of men speaking
angrily.</p>

<p>Our hero and his party being effectually screened from view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
by the dense <i>laurel</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> thicket, could listen unobserved to the
conversation of those who were approaching; and the following
expressions delivered in a loud and authoritative tone, at once
attracted and absorbed their attention: “It is impossible that
the fellow should escape, we have scouts out in every direction.
There can be no doubt that the camp which we have just
found in the woods is the one where he passed the night with
other red&ndash;skins, for the embers are still warm. Dickenson and
Brown are gone south towards Marietta; Henderson and his
party are tracking the prairies to the north: it is impossible he
should long escape; and young Hervey thinks he should know
him anywhere!”</p>

<p>While the person who appeared to be the leader of the unseen
party was thus speaking, War&ndash;Eagle whispered a few
sentences to Wingenund, to which the intelligent youth only
replied by a look; the chief then conversed apart, in a low
earnest voice, with the guide, who ended by grasping his hand,
and saying, in the Delaware tongue, “Grande&ndash;Hâche will do
it at the risk of his life.”</p>

<p>The chief appeared satisfied, and rising with calm dignity,
he tightened the belt at his waist, to which he hung his newly
acquired knife and ammunition; and throwing his rifle into
the hollow of his left arm, he said to Reginald, “War&ndash;Eagle
must leave his brother Netis; Grande&ndash;Hâche will tell him all;
before two moons have passed, Netis will come to hunt the
bison with his brother; and he shall smoke with the braves of
the Lenapé.”</p>

<p>“He will,” replied Reginald, warmly pressing his hand, and
at the same time passing the cornelian ring upon one of the
fingers of the chief. “If the Great Spirit gives him life, he
will come and hunt, and smoke with his Lenapé brother.”</p>

<p>The chief, now turning to Lucy, drew from his head the
eagle feather which was passed through his hair, and which
was quaintly stained, and ornamented with porcupine quills:
offering it gracefully to her, he said, in a voice of musical gentleness,
“War&ndash;Eagle wishes happiness to the ‘pale flower of
Mooshanne;’ many braves have tried to pluck this feather
from his head; no Dahcotah nor Pawnee has touched it and
lived! The Sister of Netis may fasten it in her hair—let none
but a brave warrior raise his eyes to it there.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear War&ndash;Eagle,” said Lucy, kindly; “I
promise you it shall never be touched by an unworthy hand;
and do you take this string of red beads,” giving him at the
same time a coral necklace, “and wear it for the sake of your
white sister.”</p>

<p>The chief received this gift with evident pleasure; and
waving his hand in adieu, whispering at the same time one
parting word to Wingenund, he strode leisurely away, and was
soon lost in the deep glades of the forest.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">HOW REGINALD BRANDON RETURNED TO MOOSHANNE WITH HIS
SISTER, ACCOMPANIED BY WINGENUND; AND WHAT BEFELL THEM
ON THE ROAD.</p>

<p class="pn">Lucy Brandon was not a little surprised at the chief’s sudden
departure; and, with the frankness natural to her character, inquired
of her brother whether he could explain its cause.
Reginald appeared either unable or unwilling to do so; and
an appeal to the guide produced only the following unsatisfactory
reply:</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle is like the bird after which he’s called—it
ain’t easy to explain or to follow his flight.”</p>

<p>Wingenund remained silent, but every now and then he
fixed his bright and speaking eyes upon Lucy, as if he would
divine her thoughts. That young lady, though at a loss to
account for her embarrassment, entertained a fear that all was
not right, and proposed to her brother to return to Mooshanne.</p>

<p>Snowdrop was soon caught, and the little party moved leisurely
homeward, Reginald and the guide leading the way, and
Wingenund walking by the side of Lucy’s pony; after riding
a few minutes, she recovered her spirits, and remembering
that there was no foundation for any surmises of evil, she
resumed the conversation with her young companion, which
the chief’s departure had interrupted. “Tell me, Wingenund,
who is the ‘Black Father,’ of whom you speak?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is very good,” said the boy, seriously; “He talks with
the Great Spirit; and he tells us all that the Great Spirit has
done; how He made the earth, and the water; and how He
punishes bad men, and makes good men happy.”</p>

<p>“He is a white man, then?” said Lucy.</p>

<p>“He is,” replied the lad; “but though he is a white man,
he always speaks truth, and does good, and drinks no fire&ndash;water,
and is never angry.”</p>

<p>What a humiliating reflection is it, thought Lucy to herself,
that in the mind of this young savage the idea of white
men is naturally associated with drunkenness and strife!
“Tell me, Wingenund,” she continued, “is the ‘Black Father’
old?”</p>

<p>“Many winters have passed over his head, and their snow
rests upon his hair.”</p>

<p>“Does he live with you always?”</p>

<p>“He comes and he goes, like the sunshine and the rain; he
is always welcome; and the Lenapé love him.”</p>

<p>“Can he speak your tongue well?”</p>

<p>“He speaks many tongues, and tries to make peace between
the tribes; but he loves the Lenapé, and he teaches ‘the
Prairie&ndash;bird’ to talk with the Great Spirit.”</p>

<p>“Does your sister speak to the Black Father in her own
tongue?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, and sometimes in the English; but often in
a strange tongue, written on a great book. The Black Father
reads it, and the Prairie&ndash;bird opens her ears, and looks on his
face, and loves his words; and then she tells them all to me.
But Wingenund is a child of the Lenapé—he cannot understand
these things!”</p>

<p>“You will understand them,” said Lucy, kindly, “if you
only have patience: you know,” she added, smiling, “your
sister understands them, and she is a Lenapé too!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the boy; “but nobody is like Prairie&ndash;bird.”</p>

<p>“She must, indeed, be a remarkable person,” said Lucy,
humouring her young companion’s fancy; “still, as you have
the same father and mother, and the same blood, whatever she
learns, you can learn too.”</p>

<p>“I have no father or mother,” said Wingenund, sadly, and
he added, in a mysterious whisper, drawing near to Lucy,
“Prairie&ndash;bird never had a father or mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never had a father or mother!” repeated Lucy, as the
painful thought occurred to her, that poor Wingenund was
deranged.</p>

<p>“Never,” said the boy, in the same tone; “she came from
<i>there</i>,” pointing, as he spoke, towards the north&ndash;west quarter
of the heaven.</p>

<p>“How melancholy is it,” said Lucy to herself, “to think
that this brave, amiable boy should be so afflicted! that so intelligent
and quick a mind should be like a lyre with a broken
string! Still,” thought she, “I will endeavour to understand
his meaning, and to undeceive him.”</p>

<p>“Dear Wingenund, you are mistaken—your sister had the
same father and mother as yourself; she may have learnt
much, and may understand things strange to you, but you
might learn them too.”</p>

<p>“Wingenund’s father and mother are dead,” said the boy,
in a voice of deep and suppressed emotion; “he will not tell
you <i>how</i> they died, for it makes his heart throb and his eyes
burn; but you are good to him, and shall not see his anger.
Prairie&ndash;bird never had a father; the Great Spirit gave her to
the Lenapé.”</p>

<p>While Lucy was musing how she should endeavour to dispel
this strange delusion, which seemed to have taken such firm
hold of her young companion’s mind, Reginald and Baptiste
halted, and the latter said, “You see that party approaching;
they may put some troublesome questions, leave me to answer
them. Wingenund, you know what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Wingenund does not understand English,” said the boy,
a slight smile of irony lurking in the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>The approaching party consisted of eight or ten men, all
armed with rifles, excepting two, who were mounted, and who
carried cutlasses and large horse&ndash;pistols; among the pedestrians
towered the gigantic form of young Mike Smith, who
has already been presented to the reader before the store of
David Muir in Marietta; and among the horsemen was the
younger Hervey, leading his friends to scour the whole country
in search of the slayer of his brother: they were all in a high
state of excitement; and despite the cool and unmoved demeanour
of the guide, he was not without apprehension that
they might desire to wreak their vengeance on Wingenund.</p>

<p>“Ha! Baptiste,” said Hervey, grasping the guide’s hand;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
“you are the very man we are in search of; we have already
been to the Colonel’s, and he told us we should find you with
his son, and with Miss Brandon, in this quarter. We want
your assistance, man, and that speedily too.”</p>

<p>“How can I serve you?” said the guide; “what is the
matter? you seem bent on a hunt.”</p>

<p>“A hunt?” exclaimed Hervey, “yes, a hunt of a red&ndash;skin
devil! Harkee, Baptiste!” and stooping from his horse, he
repeated to the guide, in a low voice, but clear enough to be
heard by all present, the circumstances attending his brother’s
death.</p>

<p>“A daring act, indeed,” said the guide musing: “but could
not you follow the trail while it was fresh, yesterday?”</p>

<p>“We followed it to a creek leading to the Muskingum, and
there we lost it.”</p>

<p>“Can you describe the appearance of the Indian?” inquired
the guide.</p>

<p>“A tall, handsome fellow, as straight as a poplar, and with
a leap like a painter, so he seemed; but d—n him, he gave me
such a knock on the head, that my eyes swam for five minutes.”</p>

<p>A cold shudder ran through Lucy’s limbs as, comparing
this slight sketch of War&ndash;Eagle with his sudden departure and
the guide’s caution to Wingenund, she recognised in the chief
the object of their search: glancing her eye timidly at Wingenund,
she could read on his countenance no traces of uneasiness;
he was playing with Snowdrop’s mane; his gun
resting on the ground, and he himself apparently unconscious
of what was passing.</p>

<p>After a minute’s reflection, the guide continued: “You say
that the Indian’s rifle was broken in half; did you notice anything
about it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing: it was a strong coarse piece; we have brought
the stock with us; here it is,” he added, calling up one of his
party to whom it had been entrusted.</p>

<p>The guide took it in his hand, and at the first glance detected
the imitation of a feather, roughly but distinctly cut with a
knife: his own suspicions were at once confirmed, although his
countenance betrayed no change of expression; but Mike
Smith, who had been looking over his shoulder, had also observed
the marks of the feather, and noticed it immediately
aloud, adding, “Come, Baptiste, you know all the Ingian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
marks between Alleghany and the Missouri; what red&ndash;skin
has this belonged to?”</p>

<p>“Mike,” said the guide coolly, “a man’s tongue must shoot
far and true to hit such a mark as that.”</p>

<p>“And yet, Baptiste, if I’d been as long at the guiding and
trapping as you, I think I’d a’ know’d something about it.”</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s the way of it,” replied Baptiste; “you young
‘uns always think you can shave a hog with a horn spoon!
I’spose, Master Mike, you can tell a buzzard from a mockingbird;
but if I was to show you a feather, and ask you <i>what</i>
buzzard it belonged to, the answer might not be easy to find.”</p>

<p>“You’re an old fool,” growled Mike, angrily; and he added,
as his eye rested suddenly upon Wingenund, “What cub is
that standing by Miss’s white pony? we’ll see if he knows this
mark. Come here, you devil’s brat.”</p>

<p>Not a muscle in the boy’s face betrayed his consciousness
that he was addressed.</p>

<p>“Come here, you young red&ndash;skin!” shouted Mike yet more
angrily, “or I’ll sharpen your movements with the point of
my knife.”</p>

<p>Reginald’s fiery temper was ill calculated to brook the young
backwoods&ndash;man’s coarse and violent language: placing himself
directly between him and Wingenund, he said to the
former in a stern and determined tone, “Master Smith, you
forget yourself; that boy is one of my company, and is not to
be exposed either to insult or injury.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a pretty coil about a young red&ndash;skin,” said Mike,
trying to conceal his anger under a forced laugh; “how do
we know that he ain’t a brother or a son of the Ingian we’re
in search of? s’ blood, if we could find out that he was, we’d
tar him, and burn him over a slow fire!”</p>

<p>“I tell you again,” said Reginald, “that he is guilty of no
crime; that he saved my life, yesterday, at the risk of his own;
and that, while I live, neither you nor any of your party shall
touch a hair of his head.”</p>

<p>Baptiste fearing the result of more angry words, and moved
by an appealing look from Miss Brandon, now interposed, and
laying his hand on Smith’s shoulder, said, “Come, Master
Mike, there is no use in threatening the young red&ndash;skin, when
you see that he does not understand a word that you say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
tell me what you wish to inquire of him, and I will ask him in
his own tongue.”</p>

<p>“His tongue be d——d,” said Mike; “I’ll wager a hat
against a gallon of David Muir’s best, that the brat knows English
as well as you or I, although he seems to have nothing to
do but to count the tassels on the edge of his shirt. I’ll show
you, without hurting him,” he added in a lower tone, “that
I’m not far wrong.”</p>

<p>“You swear not to injure him?” said Reginald, who overheard
what passed.</p>

<p>“I do,” said Mike; “I only want to show you that he
can’t make a fool of Mike Smith.” Here he called up one of
the men from the rear; and having whispered something in
his ear, he said, in a loud and distinct tone of voice, “Jack,
we have found out that this Indian cub belongs to the party,
one of whom murdered poor Hervey. Life for life is the law
of the backwoods: do you step a little on one side; I will
count four, and when I come to the four, split me the young
rascal’s head, either with a bullet or with your axe.”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, as you are men,” exclaimed Lucy, in
an agony, “spare him!”</p>

<p>“Peace, Miss Brandon,” said Mike; “your brother will explain
to you that it must be so.”</p>

<p>The guide would fain have whispered a word to the boy,
but he was too closely watched by Smith, and he was obliged
to trust to Wingenund’s nerves and intelligence.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, Jack?” said Mike, audibly.</p>

<p>“Yes!” and he counted slowly, pausing between each number,
“one—two—<i>three</i>!” At the pronunciation of this last
word, Wingenund, whose countenance had not betrayed, by the
movement of a muscle, or by the expression of a single feature,
the slightest interest in what was passing, amused himself by
patting the great rough head which Wolf rubbed against his
hand as if totally unconscious that the deadly weapon was
raised, and that the next word from the hunter’s lips was to be
his death warrant.</p>

<p>“D—n it, you are right, after all, Baptiste,” said Mike
Smith; “the brat certainly does not understand us, or he’d
have pricked his ears when I came to number three; so, do
you ask him, in his own lingo, if he knows that mark on the
rifle&ndash;butt, and can tell us to what red&ndash;skin tribe it belongs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The guide now addressed a few words to Wingenund in the
Delaware tongue, while Reginald and Lucy interchanged a
glance of wonder and admiration at the boy’s sagacity and
courage.</p>

<p>“He tells me that he has seen this mark before,” said the
guide.</p>

<p>“Has he?” replied Mike; “ask him whether it is that of
a Shawnee or a Wyandot, of an Iroquois or of a Delaware?”</p>

<p>After again conferring with Wingenund, the guide muttered
to himself, “This youngster won’t tell a lie to keep a bullet
from his brain or a halter from his neck; I must act for him.”
He added, in a louder tone, “Mike, a word with you: it is not
unlikely that the Ingian you’re in search of, is the same who
gave the boy that wound, and who tried to kill Master Reginald
yesterday: if it is so, he wants no more punishing; he
has his allowance already.”</p>

<p>“How so?” said Mike.</p>

<p>“He is dead, man,—killed on the spot. Do you and
Hervey meet me here to&ndash;morrow, an hour before noon; I
will take you to the place where the body is buried, and you
shall judge for yourselves whether it is that of the man you
seek.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bargain,” said Mike; “we’ll come to the time. Now,
lads, forward to Hervey’s clearing. Let’s have a merry
supper to&ndash;night; and to&ndash;morrow, if the guide shows us the
carcase of this rascal, why we can’t hurt that much; but we’ll
pay off a long score, one day or other, with some of the red&ndash;skins.
Sorry to have kept you waitin’, Miss; and hope we
haven’t scared you,” said the rough fellow, making, as he drew
off his party, an awkward attempt at a parting bow to Lucy.</p>

<p>“That was a clever turn of Baptiste’s,” said Reginald in a
low voice to his sister; “he has made them believe that the
cowardly knave who tried to stab me was the perpetrator of
the daring outrage which they seek to avenge!”</p>

<p>“And was it really War&ndash;Eagle?” said Lucy, with a slight
shudder,—“he who looks so noble and so gentle,—was it he
who did it?”</p>

<p>“I believe so,” said Reginald.</p>

<p>“But is it not wrong in us to be friends with him, and to
aid his escape?”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” replied her brother, “it admits of doubt; let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
ask the guide, he will speak now without reserve;” and accordingly
Reginald repeated to Baptiste the question and his
sister’s scruples.</p>

<p>“Why you see, Miss,” said the wary hunter, “there is no
proof that War&ndash;Eagle did it; though I confess it was too bold
a deed to have been done by that dog of a Wyandot: but I
will tell you, Miss,” he added, with increasing energy and vehemence,
“<span class="smcap">if</span> the War&ndash;Eagle did it, you will yourself, when
you know all, confess that he did it nobly, and that he deserves
no punishment from man. That elder Hervey was one of the
bloodthirsty band by whom the harmless Christian Indians<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
were murdered; and it is believed that it was by Hervey’s
own hand that Wingenund’s father fell; <i>if</i> War&ndash;Eagle revenged
this cruel murder, and yet spared the life of the
younger brother, when lying helpless at his feet, who shall
dare to blame him, or move a foot in his pursuit?”</p>

<p>“He speaks the truth, Lucy,” said her brother; “according
to the rules by which retaliation is practised by mankind,
War&ndash;Eagle would have been justified in punishing with death
such an act of unprovoked atrocity: but it is a dangerous subject
to discuss; you had better forget <i>all</i> you have heard
about it; and in case of further inquiries being made in your
presence, imitate the happy unconsciousness lately displayed
by Wingenund.”</p>

<p>“Come here, my dear young brother,” he added in a kindly
tone, “and tell us,—did you really think that hot&ndash;headed
chap was going to shoot you when he counted number three?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the boy with a scornful smile.</p>

<p>“And why not? for he’s a violent and angry man.”</p>

<p>“He dared not,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“He is a fool!” said the boy, in the same scornful tone;
“a fool scarcely fit to frighten the fawn of an antelope! If he
had touched me or attempted to shoot me, Netis and Grande&ndash;Hâche
would have killed him immediately.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my young brave,” said Reginald, “he
dared not hurt you. See, dear Lucy,” he added apart to his
sister, “what a ripe judgment, what an heroic spirit, what
nerves of iron, are found in the slender frame of this wounded
boy, exhausted by fatigue and suffering!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“We will at least give him a hearty supper,” said Lucy,
“and an affectionate welcome to our home.”</p>

<p>Wingenund thanked her with his dark eyes, and the little
party proceeded leisurely, without incident or interruption, to
Mooshanne.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">IN WHICH THE READER IS UNCEREMONIOUSLY TRANSPORTED TO
ANOTHER ELEMENT IN COMPANY WITH ETHELSTON; THE LATTER
IS LEFT IN A DISAGREEABLE PREDICAMENT.</p>

<p class="pn">It is time that we should now turn our attention to Ethelston,
who is much too important a personage in our narrative to be
so long neglected, and respecting whose safety Lucy began to
feel the jealous anxiety of love; for The Pride of Ohio had
been long expected in Marietta, and several French frigates
and corvettes were reported to be cruising among the West
Indian Islands, actively engaged in revenging upon American
commerce the loss which they had sustained in The Insurgente.
We shall soon see that Lucy’s alarm was not altogether groundless,
and that her lover’s prolonged absence was not without
sufficient cause. About a month preceding the occurrences
detailed in the last chapter, Ethelston, having landed his merchandise
in safety at Port Royal, and having taken on board a
small cargo of sugar and coffee, prepared to return to New
Orleans. He had heard of the French men&ndash;of&ndash;war cruising in
the neighbourhood, and prudently resolved to risk as little as
possible on this trip: he took therefore securities for a great
portion of the amount due to him, which he left in the charge
of the vessel’s consignees, and conveyed on board only a sufficient
cargo to put The Pride of Ohio in perfect sailing trim,
and to give her a fair chance of escape in case she were chased
by an enemy. His little brig was well rigged and manned, and
he felt confident that few, if any, of the French cruisers would
match her for speed. His mate, or sailing&ndash;master, was Gregson,
a hardy weather&ndash;beaten old sailor, who had served on
board of every kind of craft, from a man&ndash;of&ndash;war to a fishing&ndash;cobble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and knew every headland, reef, and current in that
dangerous sea, as well as a Liverpool pilot knows the banks
and shoals in the mouth of the Mersey. The Pride of Ohio
mounted three guns; two eighteen&ndash;pound carronades, and one
long nine&ndash;pounder: ten stout fellows and a black cook completed
her complement: the last&ndash;mentioned person deserves
special notice, as he was a character strangely formed by the
alternations of fortune which he had seen. A native of the
interior of western Africa, he had in early life been chosen,
on account of his extraordinary strength and courage, a chief
of the Lucumi tribe, to which he belonged; but having been
unfortunately made a prisoner, he was taken down to the coast
and sold to a slaver: thence he had been conveyed to some of
the Spanish Islands, and afterwards to Virginia, where he had
come into possession of Colonel Brandon, who finding him
possessed of many good qualities, and of a sagacity very rare
among his countrymen, had offered him his liberty when he
moved to Ohio; but Cupid (for so was the negro called) had
grown so much attached to his master, that he begged to be
allowed to remain in his service, and, from one employment to
another, had now become cook and steward on board The
Pride of Ohio. In frame he was Herculean; and though he
rarely exerted his strength, he had shown on various occasions
that it was nearly if not quite equal to that of any other two
men in the vessel. He spoke but little, and was sullen and
reserved in his manners; but as he never disobeyed orders,
and never was guilty of aggression or violence, Cupid was,
upon the whole, a favourite with the crew.</p>

<p>To Ethelston he was invaluable; for he was always at his
post, was scrupulously honest with respect to money or stores
placed under his charge, and on more than one occasion his
shrewdness and readiness had surprised his young commander.
The captain (for so was Ethelston called on board) always
treated Cupid kindly, and never allowed him to be made the
subject of those jeers and insults to which free negroes in the
States are usually exposed. On this account the cook, who
never forgot that he <i>had</i> been a warrior, entertained towards
him the warmest feelings of attachment and gratitude.</p>

<p>How or where he had obtained the name he bore, none
seemed to know; and Ethelston remembered having heard that
when first he came into Colonel Brandon’s possession, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
asked his name, he had sullenly replied, “The name I once
had is at home: a slave has neither name nor home!” A
terrible gash across his forehead and left cheek (received, probably,
in the war when he was captured,) had disfigured a
countenance that had been originally expressive of haughtiness
and determination, and had, perhaps, led the slave&ndash;dealer
to bestow upon him in irony the name by which he was now
called.</p>

<p>The Pride of Ohio had made good two days of her homeward
passage, when, in endeavouring to round a point on the
southern coast of Cuba, Ethelston descried a ship some miles
to windward, and a&ndash;head, which a careful examination through
his glass convinced him was a French frigate. His mate
being below at the time, he sent for him on deck, anxious to
see whether the experienced sailor’s observation would confirm
his opinion. As soon as he appeared, handing him the glass,
he said, “Gregson, see what you make of that fellow on our
larboard bow.”</p>

<p>“Make of her!” said the mate; “the devil take him that
made her, and him that brought her athwart us, say I, captain!
She’s a Frenchman; and though we can’t well see her
hull yet, I doubt it won’t be long before we see her row of
teeth.”</p>

<p>“I thought so myself,” said Ethelston. “We must hold
our course steady; and if we can round the point, we may
then bear away, and show her a pair of heels. Turn the
hands up, Gregson; trim the sails, and stand by for a run.
Put Harrison at the helm; he can keep her a point nearer
than that youngster.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir!” was the reply; and having executed the
order, he returned to Ethelston, who was still sweeping the
southern horizon with his glass, and examining the strange
ship, whose hull was now distinctly visible.</p>

<p>The young man’s countenance wore a grave expression, as,
returning the glass to his mate, he said, “Gregson, it is, as we
supposed, a French frigate. We may, perhaps, creep along
under the shore without his noticing our small craft.”</p>

<p>The old seaman riveted the glass upon the stranger, as if he
wished to count every sail and plank. During the examination,
he grunted two or three inarticulate ejaculations, in
unison with which his hard features underwent various contortions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and his young commander waited with no little impatience
for what he called his “overhauling.”</p>

<p>“She’s neither more nor less than that infernal Epervier,
commanded by L’Estrange. She’s one of the fastest sailers in
their navy; and as for our creeping past her without being
seen, he’s the wrong sort o’ man for that fun: herring or
whale, all’s fish for his net!”</p>

<p>“I have often heard of him,” said Ethelston: “they say
he’s a fine fellow.”</p>

<p>“That he is, to give the devil his due, as jolly an old dog as
ever lived, and much too good a seaman for a mounseer.
Look’ee there, captain,” added he, after another squint through
the glass; “he’s altering his course already—two or three
points free, and the reefs shaken out o’ the tops’ls. We shall
hear from him soon.”</p>

<p>“Can we give him the slip by bearing up for the eastern
passage?—We should then show him our tail; and a stern
chase is a long one.”</p>

<p>“We might try if you wish it, captain; but it blows
fresh, and she won’t be very fond of this lee shore. I think,
if you allow me to advise, we’d better hug it; take the chance
of a long shot in rounding that headland, and then run for the
inner channel behind the Isle of Pines. He’ll not be after
following us there; or, if he does, the frigate’s keel will
chance to scrape acquaintance with a reef.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Gregson,” said Ethelston. “The Pride
may fetch that point on this tack. Keep a close luff, Harrison.”</p>

<p>“Luff it is, sir,” was the reply, as Ethelston went below to
consult his chart, and to prepare himself for entering the
intricate channel between the Isle de Pinos and the main
island.</p>

<p>The gallant little brig well sustained her high character as
a sailer, and dashed her bows fearlessly through the foaming
waves, under a press of canvasss such as few vessels of her
tonnage could have borne. The breeze was freshening, and
the frigate now shaped her course with the evident intention
of cutting off the chase from rounding the headland before
mentioned.</p>

<p>The men on board the brig were now clustered forward,
anxiously debating the probable issue; while Cupid steamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
away in his caboose, preparing the dinner as quietly as if
there had been no frigate to windward, nor a rock&ndash;bound
shore to leeward; but though he seemed thus busied in his
usual avocations, he cast every now and then his dark eye
upon The Epervier; and few on board could estimate better
than himself the danger of their situation.</p>

<p>Ethelston, having finished a careful examination of his chart,
now came on deck, and a single glance sufficed to show him
that he could not round the point a&ndash;head without coming
within range of the frigate’s guns: but the brig had kept her
offing, and he had little doubt of her making good her escape,
unless she were crippled by a shot from the enemy.</p>

<p>The Epervier now hoisted her colours for the brig to heave&ndash;to;
and that being disregarded, she fired a shot, which fell
short of her bows. Finding that no notice was taken of this,
L’Estrange ordered his first lieutenant to fire at the saucy
brig in good earnest, to bring her to her senses. Fortunately
for the latter, there was a short angry sea running, and the
distance being considerable, the first shot did not take effect.
Several of the hands on board the brig had served in men&ndash;of&ndash;war;
these were now oracles among their messmates, and they
looked with some anxiety at their young captain, curious to
see how he would behave under fire, for they believed he had
never smelt powder: and although strict and firm in his command,
he was usually so gentle and quiet in his manner, that
they considered him rather a studious than a fighting character.
Their curiosity was not, however, much gratified;
for Ethelston, without appearing to notice the frigate, kept
his eye steadfastly fixed upon the cape a&ndash;head; and, after a
brief silence, he said, “Gregson, there is a strong current
which sets in shore here, The Pride cannot weather that
point on this tack.”</p>

<p>“You are right, sir,” said the mate; “L’Estrange has got
his bristles up, he is nearing us every minute, and if we carry
on this course, in another half&ndash;hour, both will go ashore.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the young captain, the colour rising in
his cheek, as a sudden thought flashed across him. “If we
could ensure that both would go to pieces among those breakers,
it would be a glorious death for the little brig to die!”</p>

<p>He spoke these words in an under tone, and rather musing
to himself than addressing his officer. The latter, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
overheard them, and looked at him with an astonishment
which he could not repress; for he also knew as little as the
crew of the determined courage that reposed under the calm
and quiet demeanour of his young commander. Again a
wreath of smoke issued from the bows of the frigate, and a
round shot passed through the rigging of the chase, doing
fortunately no material damage, but proving that they were
now within easy range.</p>

<p>“I fear it will not do, sir,” said the mate, in reply to
Ethelston’s last words; “she can pepper away at us, and yet
make her offing good.”</p>

<p>“Then there remains but one chance for us,” said the
captain; “answer her signal, show your colours, ‘bout ship,
and stand for the frigate.”</p>

<p>The mate was, if possible, more surprised at this order than
he had been before at the proposal to try and cast both vessels
ashore; but he was too good a seaman to hesitate or to ask
any questions; and in a few minutes the gallant little brig had
answered the signal, and was standing out towards the frigate
on the starboard tack.</p>

<p>We will now transport the reader for a few minutes on
board The Epervier, and make him acquainted with the captain,
into whose clutches the poor little brig seemed destined to fall.
L’Estrange was a fine&ndash;looking, middle&ndash;aged man, who had
spent the greater part of his life at sea, and had married,
when very young, a Spanish creole, whose beauty was her
only dower; he had several children by this marriage, the
eldest of whom was now a lieutenant on board his ship; the
remainder of the family resided at Point à Pitre, in Guadaloupe,
for the captain was in truth rather of the “ancien
régime;” he loved his country, but he hated the Directory
and other fruits of the French revolution; so that he never
went to Europe, and would have been but rarely employed,
had he not been known to be one of the most skilful and experienced
officers in the French navy. Such was the man
who now stood on the frigate’s quarter&ndash;deck; and after examining
The Pride again through his glass, turned to his
first lieutenant and desired him to cease firing. “That obstinate
trader,” added he, “seemed very anxious to escape, and
thought but little of the risk she ran of going ashore, or of
being riddled by our shot!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s one of those saucy Americans,” said the lieutenant,
“that think nothing afloat can match ‘em; however, she’s
made a mistake this time; and I hope, sir, when she’s overhauled,
she’ll prove worth the trouble she’s given.”</p>

<p>The frigate, by this time, finding herself too close in on a
lee shore, hauled to the wind; and, disliking the broken and
rugged appearance of the coast, determined not to lie&ndash;to for
the brig until she had made sufficient offing. This was precisely
the calculation that Ethelston had made; and he now
paced his deck with a calm and satisfied countenance; whilst
his men, grouped on the forecastle, were quite at a loss to discover
his intentions: the mate, however, was clearer sighted,
and could not withhold his admiration from the decision and
boldness of a man&oelig;uvre, the success of which must soon be
tested.</p>

<p>The captain of the frigate went below to dinner, having
given orders to the lieutenant to stand out on the same tack
for another half&ndash;hour, then to lie&ndash;to, until the brig should come
alongside.</p>

<p>Meantime, Ethelston, who had kept his eye fixed upon the
headland so often mentioned, muttering to himself, “she will
fetch it now,” desired the man at the helm to yaw the brig
about, to throw her up now and then in the wind, so as to fall
astern of the frigate as much as possible, yet not apparently
varying the course. Having done so as long as he judged it
practicable without awakening the enemy’s suspicion, he saw,
to his inexpressible delight, the frigate shorten sail to enable
him to come up; instantly seizing this advantage, he ordered
his mate to put the brig about, and run for the Isle of Pines.
It may well be imagined that this bold man&oelig;uvre was not many
moments unperceived on board the frigate; and L’Estrange’s
astonishment was great, when, from the noise overhead, and
from the heeling of the ship, he found that her course was
being altered. Springing on deck, he saw that he had been
outwitted by the saucy brig, which was crowding all sail, and
seemed not unlikely to effect her escape. The old captain
chafed, and stormed, and swore that the obstinate little trader
should pay dearly for her insolence.</p>

<p>The Epervier was a fast sailer, and, as she now dashed the
spray from her bows under a press of canvass, it was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
evident that the brig could not yet round the point without
coming within range of her guns.</p>

<p>Ethelston’s mind was now made up; and finding his men
cheerful and inspirited by the success of his man&oelig;uvre, he yet
hoped to bring his vessel into the intricate channel behind the
island, where the frigate would not venture to follow: it was
not long before she again saluted him; and one of the shot
passing through the brig’s bulwarks, close to him, shivered the
binnacle into a hundred pieces. Observing symptoms of uneasiness
in the man at the helm, and that he swerved from
the course, Ethelston gave him a stern reproof, and again desired
Harrison to come to the helm. The frigate, which still
held the weather&ndash;gage, seemed now resolved to cut off the brig
from the headland, and to sink her if she attempted to weather
it. Ethelston saw his full danger, and was prepared to meet
it; had he commanded a vessel of war, however small, he
would not have shrunk from the responsibility he was about
to incur; but, remembering that his little brig was but a
trader, and that the crew ought not to be exposed, without
their own consent, to danger so imminent as that before them,
he desired Gregson to call them aft, when he addressed them
as follows:</p>

<p>“My lads,—you see the scrape we are in: if we can round
that point, we may yet escape; but to do so, we must run
within a few hundred yards of the frigate’s broadside. What
say you, my lads, shall we strike, or stand the chance?—a
French prison, or hurrah for the Belise?”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the Belise,” shouted the men, animated by
their young commander’s words, and by his fearless bearing;
so the little brig held on her way.</p>

<p>A few minutes proved that he had neither magnified nor
underrated the danger: his chart gave him deep water round
the headland; and he now ordered Harrison to keep her away,
and let her run close in shore, thereby increasing her speed,
and the distance from the enemy.</p>

<p>The surprise and wrath of L’Estrange, at the impudent
daring of a craft which he now perceived to be really nothing
but an insignificant trader, are not to be described. He bore
up after her, and having desired the men to stand to their
guns, generously determined to give the saucy chase one more
chance; but finding his repeated signal for her to heave&ndash;to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
disregarded, he reluctantly gave the order to fire. Fortunately
for The Pride, the sea was running high, and naval gunnery
had not then reached the perfection which it has since
attained; and though her rigging was cut up from stem to
stern, and her fore&ndash;topmast was shot away, and though she
received several shot in her hull, she still answered her helm,
and gallantly rounding the point, ran in shore, and was in a
few minutes among shoals which, to her light draught, were
not dangerous, but where it would have been madness in the
frigate to follow.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">ETHELSTON’S FURTHER ADVENTURES AT SEA, AND HOW HE BECAME
CAPTOR AND CAPTIVE IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME.</p>

<p class="pn">It seemed almost miraculous that not a man on The Pride
of the Ohio was killed by the frigate’s broadside; nor was one
wounded, excepting Ethelston, who received a slight hurt in
the left arm from a splinter; but he paid no attention to it,
and calmly gave all the requisite orders for repairing the
damaged spars and rigging.</p>

<p>As soon as all was made snug, he let the men go below to
dinner; and leaning over the shivered bulwarks of his little
craft, seemed busily employed in counting the shot that had
struck her; but his eyes were for a time fixed upon the water,
through which she was cutting her easy way, and his thoughts
were afar off, as he whispered almost audibly to himself, “Dear,
dear Lucy—your namesake is wounded and disfigured, but
she is not disgraced. Thank Heaven, no Frenchman’s foot
has yet trodden her deck, and—“</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by Gregson, who having been carefully
observing the frigate through his glass, came up to him,
and said, “Beg pardon, sir; but she is getting ready her boats,
and the breeze is failing fast; in another hour we shall have
scarce a cat’s paw.”</p>

<p>Ethelston started from his short reverie, and immediately
convinced himself that the mate spoke the truth: “You are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
right,” said he, “but we have a good hour to spare, for the
frigate is nearly becalmed. Let the men have their dinner
quietly, say nothing to them about the matter, and give ‘em
an extra glass of grog; but no drunkenness, Gregson; they
may want the full use of their heads and hands to&ndash;night; send
Cupid to my cabin, and tell him to bring me a slice of cold
meat and a glass of Madeira.”</p>

<p>So saying, he went below: the mate looked after him, and
turning his quid three or four times in his cheek, he muttered,
“Damme if he makes any more count of the frigate’s guns or
boats than a bear does of a bee&ndash;hive! They spoilt as good a
commodore as ever stept a deck when they made a trading&ndash;skipper
of him!” Having vented this characteristic encomium
on his young commander, the old seaman went forward to
execute his orders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ethelston, consulting his chart, found that the
reefs and shoals, as laid down, rendered the navigation of the
coast extremely dangerous, even for the light draught of his
brig; having only allowed himself a few minutes for refreshment,
he again went on deck, and observing the frigate still
becalmed, he ordered the mate to shorten sail, take soundings,
and to desire the carpenter to make a report of the leakage, or
any other serious injury sustained by the frigate’s shot.</p>

<p>During this time L’Estrange was not idle on board The
Epervier. Nettled at the successful trick played upon him,
he resolved as the breeze gradually died away to capture the
chase with his boats: for this duty the launch and the pinnace
were assigned: the former had a carronade and twenty&ndash;five
hands, and was commanded by his son; the latter had a
swivel, and thirteen hands, commanded by a junior lieutenant.
The object of L’Estrange being to prevent an unnecessary
effusion of blood, by sending a force strong enough to render
resistance hopeless on the part of what he called a dirty little
sugar&ndash;boat. The crew of The Pride of Ohio, elated by the
success of their captain’s man&oelig;uvre, and exhilarated by the
extra grog served out, were in high good humour, and laughing
over the events of the morning with reckless merriment,
when they received an order from Ethelston to come aft. On
their obeying the summons, he again addressed them as follows:—</p>

<p>“My lads, you have thus far done your duty like men; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
our work is not yet over. The Epervier is determined to sink
or capture our little craft; she is now getting out her boats
for that service: if we resist, we shall have warm work of it;
if we strike without a fight, we may rot in a French dungeon.
Again I ask you, my lads, will you stick by The Pride, and
hurrah for home, or a sailor’s grave?”</p>

<p>A hearty and simultaneous cheer from the crew was the
only reply.</p>

<p>“I knew it, my lads,” continued Ethelston, his countenance,
usually so calm, now glowing with enthusiasm; “I
knew that you would not desert her while she could float! It
is now my duty to tell you that she has received two awkward
shots just between wind and water line, and that she
leaks apace. We must stop them as well as we may; but be
prepared for the boats from The Epervier;—they shall at least
buy us a dear bargain!”</p>

<p>Ethelston now called the mate, and gave him full instructions
for the plan of defence from the expected attack. The
long gun and the carronades were got ready and loaded, the
former with round shot, the latter with grape; small arms and
cutlasses were served out to the men, and the deck cleared of
every thing that might impede them in the approaching struggle.
Meantime Ethelston ordered to be hoisted a new ensign, given
to the brig by Lucy, and said to be partly worked by her own
fair fingers. As soon as it was run up, he sent aloft a boy, with
orders to nail it to the mast&ndash;head, which was done amid the
repeated cheers of the crew. They were not long kept in suspense:
the breeze had died away; the flapping sails and
creaking yards gave the usual sullen indications of a calm,
when the boats from The Epervier advanced at a steady and
measured stroke towards the brig. Ethelston gave the long
gun to the charge of Gregson, reserving to himself that of the
carronades; he issued also special orders not to fire, under any
circumstances, until he gave the word, or, in case he fell, until
they received the order from Gregson, who would succeed him
in the command.</p>

<p>During all these preparations, Cupid appeared indifferent to
what was passing, and continued busily occupied with his pots
and pans in the caboose. This conduct caused some little
surprise in Ethelston, who knew that the black was not the
stupid, phlegmatic character that he now seemed; and he accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sent Gregson to inquire whether, in the event of an
attack from the frigate’s boats, he meant to fight?—desiring
the mate at the same time to offer him a cutlass. The African
grinned when he received this message, and replied that he
meant to do his best. He declined, however, the proffered
cutlass, informing the mate, that he had got a toasting&ndash;fork of
his own, ready for the mounseers; as he said this, he showed
him the fragment of a capstan&ndash;bar, the end of which he had
sharpened and burnt hard in the hot cinders: it was an unwieldy
kind of club, and in the hands of an ordinary man,
could have been but of little service; but his gigantic strength
enabled him to wield it like a common cudgel. The truth is,
that Cupid would have preferred being armed with cutlass and
pistol, both of which he could use as well as any man on
board; but he had tact enough to know that the prejudice
against his colour forbad his taking his place on deck among
the other defenders of the vessel.</p>

<p>The boats being now within hail, Lieutenant L’Estrange
stood up in the launch and ordered the brig to strike her colours
and receive him on board. Finding this order unheeded,
he repeated it through the trumpet in a sterner tone, adding
that, if not immediately obeyed, he should fire upon her. Not
a man stirred on board the brig, neither was any reply made
to the lieutenant, who forthwith discharged the contents of his
carronade into her hull, by which one man was killed dead,
and two were wounded by splinters; he then desired his men
to pull hard for the brig to board her, while others had orders
to fire small arms at all whom they could see above the bulwarks.
The boats had approached within fifty yards before
Ethelston gave the word to fire. Gregson pointed the long
gun upon the smaller boat with so true an aim that the heavy
shot went clean through her, and she filled and went down in
a few minutes, the survivors of her crew being picked up by
the launch. Meanwhile, Ethelston fired a volley of grape
into the latter with terrible effect, several being killed on the
spot, and many of the remainder severely wounded. Nothing
daunted by this murderous fire, the gallant young lieutenant
held on his way to the brig, and again discharging his carronade
at the distance of only a few yards, her timbers were
fearfully rent, and amidst the smoke and confusion thereby
created, he and his crew scrambled up her sides to board. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
combat was now hand to hand; nor was it very unequal, so
many of the Frenchmen having been killed and wounded in
the boats; they were strong enough, however, to make good
their footing on deck, and inch by inch they forced back the
crew of the brig. Ethelston fought with the courage of a
lion; his voice was heard above the din of the fray, animating
his men; and several of the boldest of the enemy had already
felt the edge of his cutlass. Nor was young L’Estrange
less gallant in his attack; and his followers being more numerous
than their opponents, drove them back gradually by main
force. It was at this moment that Cupid, who had hitherto
remained unnoticed in his caboose, thought fit to commence
his operations; which he did by throwing a great pan of
greasy boiling water over three or four of the assailants, and
then laying about him with his huge club, which felled
a man almost at every blow. The excruciating pain occasioned
by the hot liquid, together with the consternation produced
by this unexpected attack in their rear, completed the
dismay of the Frenchmen. At this crisis young L’Estrange
slipped and fell on the deck: Gregson, bestriding him, was
about to dispatch him; when Ethelston, who was already
bleeding from a severe cutlass wound in the forehead, rushed
forward to save him; but the infuriated youth, perhaps mistaking
his intention, drew his last remaining pistol, and fired
with so true an aim, that Ethelston’s left arm fell powerless
at his side. A flush of anger came over his countenance;
but seeing Gregson again raising his hand to dispatch the
young officer, he again interposed, and desired the mate to
spare him,—an order which the seaman reluctantly obeyed.</p>

<p>Ethelston now entreated L’Estrange to give up his sword,
and to save further bloodshed; and the young man, seeing
that his followers were mostly overpowered and wounded,
presented it with a countenance in which grief and shame
were blended with indignation. “Stay,” said Ethelston;
“before I receive your sword, the conditions on which I receive
it are, that you give your parole, that neither you nor
any one of your men shall bear arms against the United
States during the continuance of this war, whether you and I
are recaptured or not; and the launch becomes my prize.”</p>

<p>To these terms the youth assented, and ordered such of his men
as were not quite disabled, to lay down their arms. In a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
minutes, all who were unhurt were busily engaged in tending
the dying and wounded. Fortunately an assistant&ndash;surgeon,
who had volunteered on this service from the frigate, was
among those unhurt, and he set about his professional duties
with as much alacrity as if he had been in the ward of an
hospital. Cupid retreated quietly to his caboose, and Ethelston
continued giving his orders with the same clearness and
decision that had marked his whole conduct. Young L’Estrange
looked over the brig’s low sides into the water: his heart was
too full for utterance; and his captor, with considerate kindness,
abstained from addressing him. The surgeon, observing
that the blood still flowed from the wound on Ethelston’s
forehead, and that his left arm hung at his side, now came and
offered his services. Thanking him courteously, he replied,
smiling, “I took my chance of wounds on equal terms with
those brave fellows, and I will take my chance of cure on
equal terms also; when you have attended to all those who
are more seriously hurt, I shall be happy to avail myself of
your skill.”</p>

<p>The surgeon bowed and withdrew. An audible groan
burst from the unhappy L’Estrange; but still he spoke not;
and Ethelston held a brief consultation with his mate and the
carpenter, the result of which was, an order given to the
former, in a low tone of voice, “to prepare immediately, and
to send Cupid to him in the cabin.”</p>

<p>As he was going down, L’Estrange came to him, and asked
him, confusedly, and with an averted countenance, if he
might speak to him alone for a minute. Ethelston begged
him to follow him into his cabin, when, having shut the door,
he said, “Mr. L’Estrange, we are alone, pray speak; is there
any thing in which I can serve you?”</p>

<p>The youth gazed on him for a moment, in an agony that
could not yet find relief in words, and then falling on the
floor, burst into a flood of tears. Ethelston was moved and
surprised at this violent grief in one whom he had so lately
seen under the influence of pride and passion. Taking him
kindly by the hand, he said, “Pray compose yourself! these
are misfortunes to which all brave men are liable. You did
all that a gallant officer could do;—success is at the disposal
of a higher power; you will meet it another day.”</p>

<p>“Never, never!” said the young lieutenant, vehemently;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
“the loss of my boat is nothing; the failure of our attack is
nothing; but I am a dishonoured coward, and Heaven itself
cannot restore a tainted honour!”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” replied Ethelston; “you must not say so. I
maintain that you and your crew fought gallantly till every
hope of success was gone—the bravest can do no more!”</p>

<p>“You are blindly generous,” said the youth passionately;
“you <i>will</i> not understand me! When every hope was gone—when
I lay at the mercy of your mate’s cutlass—you sprang
forward to save my life. I, like a savage—a monster—a
coward, as I am,—fired and tried to kill you;—even then,
without a word of anger or reproach, you, although wounded
by my pistol, again interposed, and saved me from the death
I deserved. Oh, would that I had died an hundred deaths
rather than have lived to such disgrace!”</p>

<p>And again the unhappy young officer buried his face in his
hands, while his whole frame still trembled convulsively with
grief. Ethelston used every exertion to soothe and allay his
agitation. He assured him that the wound he had received
was not serious, that the pistol was fired under a strong excitement,
and in the turmoil of a bloody fray, when no man’s
thoughts are sufficiently collected to regulate his conduct; and
he forgave him so freely, and mingled his forgiveness with so
many expressions of kindness and esteem, that he succeeded
at length in restoring him to a certain degree of composure.
Nothing, however, would satisfy L’Estrange but that he should
have his wounds instantly dressed; and he ran himself and
summoned the surgeon, resolving to be present at the operation.</p>

<p>When Ethelston’s clothes were removed, it appeared that,
besides a few flesh&ndash;cuts, of no great consequence, he had received
two severe shot wounds: one from a musket&ndash;ball, which
had sunk deep into the left shoulder; the other from L’Estrange’s
pistol, by which the bone of the left arm was broken.
The latter was soon set and bandaged; but the ball could not
be extracted from the former, either because the surgeon’s skill
was not equal to the task, or from his not having with him
the instruments requisite for the operation. As soon as this
was over, Ethelston dismissed the surgeon; and turning good&ndash;humouredly
to L’Estrange he said, “Now, my young friend,
I want your assistance. I must lose no time in putting all
our men aboard the launch, and taking in as many stores and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
necessaries as she will hold, for this brig is doomed; your
swivel and the frigate’s guns have finished her; she is fast
settling down, and in a couple of hours I expect her to sink.”</p>

<p>“On my word, sir,” said L’Estrange, “you will pardon me
if I say that you are the strangest gentleman that I ever yet
knew to command a trading brig! You out&ndash;man&oelig;uvre a frigate,
capture her boats, fight as if you had done nothing but
fight all your life, sit as quiet under that surgeon’s probes and
tortures as if you were eating your dinner, and now talk
calmly of scuttling your brig, for which you have run all
these risks!”</p>

<p>“It is my philosophy, Monsieur L’Estrange. I tried first
to get away without fighting; when that was impossible, I
fought as well as I could. What has happened since, and
what is yet to come, I bear as well as I can! All that I ask
of you is, to keep your fellows in order, and make them assist
mine in removing the wounded and the requisite stores on
board the launch.” So saying, and again saluting his prisoner,
he went on deck.</p>

<p>Though he struggled thus manfully against his emotion, it
was with a heavy heart that Ethelston prepared to bid a final
adieu to his little vessel, which he loved much for her own
sake,—more perhaps for the name she bore. While giving
the necessary orders for this melancholy duty, his attention was
called by Gregson to a sail that was coming up with the light
evening breeze astern. One look through the glass sufficed to
show him that she hoisted French colours; and L’Estrange,
who now came on deck, immediately knew her to be The
Hirondelle,—an armed cutter, that acted on this cruise as a
tender to The Epervier. A momentary glow overspread the
countenance of Ethelston, as he felt that resistance was hopeless,
and that in another hour his brig would be sunk, and his brave
crew prisoners. But being too proud to allow the French
officer to see his emotion, he controlled it by a powerful effort,
and continued to give his orders with his accustomed coolness
and precision.</p>

<p>Though young L’Estrange’s heart beat high at this sudden
and unlooked&ndash;for deliverance, he could not forbear his admiration
at his captor’s self&ndash;possession; and his own joy was damped
by the remembrance of that portion of his own conduct which
he had so deeply lamented, and also of the parole he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
given, not to bear arms again during the war. Meantime the
removal of the men, the stores, the provisions, and papers from
the brig went on with the greatest order and despatch.</p>

<p>Ethelston was the last to leave her: previous to his doing
so, he made the carpenter knock out the oakum and other temporary
plugs with which he had stopped the leaks, being determined
that she should not fall into the hands of the French.
This being completed, the launch shoved off; and while pulling
heavily for the shore, the crew looked in gloomy silence
at their ill&ndash;fated brig. Ethelston was almost unmanned; for
his heart and his thoughts were on Ohio’s banks, and he could
not separate the recollections of Lucy from the untimely fate
of her favourite vessel. He gazed until his sight and brain
grew dizzy; he fancied that he saw Lucy’s form on the deck
of the brig, and that she stretched her arms to him for aid.
Even while he thus looked, the waters poured fast into their
victim. She settled,—sunk; and in a few minutes scarce a
bubble on their surface told where The Pride of Ohio had
gone down! A groan burst from Ethelston’s bosom. Nature
could no longer endure the accumulated weight of fatigue and
intense pain occasioned by his wounds: he sunk down insensible
in the boat, and when he recovered his senses, found himself
a prisoner on board The Hirondelle.</p>

<p>Great had been the surprise of the lieutenant who commanded
her at the disappearance of the brig which he had been
sent to secure; and greater still at the condition of the persons
found on board the launch. His inquiries were answered by
young L’Estrange with obvious reluctance: so having paid the
last melancholy duties to the dead, and afforded all the assistance
in his power to the wounded, he put about the cutter,
and made sail for The Epervier.</p>

<p>As soon as young L’Estrange found himself on the frigate’s
deck, he asked for an immediate and private audience of his
father, to whom he detailed without reserve all the circumstances
of the late expedition. He concluded his narration
with the warmest praises of Ethelston’s courage, conduct, and
humanity, while he repeated that bitter censure of his own
behaviour which he had before expressed on board The Pride
of Ohio. The gallant old captain, though mortified at the
failure of the enterprise and the loss of men that he had sustained,
could not but appreciate the candour, and feel for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
mortification of his favourite son; and he readily promised
that Ethelston should be treated with the greatest care and
kindness, and that the most favourable terms, consistent with
his duty, should be offered to the prisoners.</p>

<p>Young L’Estrange gave up his own berth to Ethelston,
whose severe sufferings had been succeeded by a weakness and
lethargy, yet more dangerous. The surgeon was ordered to
attend him; and his care was extended to all the wounded,
without distinction of country.</p>

<p>After a few days, Captain L’Estrange determined to exchange
Gregson, the mate, and the remainder of the brig’s
crew, for some French prisoners lately taken by an American
privateer: they were accordingly placed for that purpose
on board the cutter, and sent to New Orleans. Young
L’Estrange having learned from the mate the address of
Colonel Brandon, and his connection with Ethelston, wrote him
a letter, in which he mentioned the latter in the highest and
most affectionate terms, assuring the Colonel that he should be
treated as if he were his own brother; and that, although the
danger arising from his wounds rendered it absolutely necessary
that he should return to Guadaloupe with the frigate, his friends
might rely upon his being tended with the same care as if he
had been at home. Cupid, at his own urgent entreaty, remained
with his master, taking charge of all his private baggage and
papers.</p>

<p>We need not follow the fate of the cutter any further than
to say that she reached her destination in safety; that the proposed
exchange was effected, and the prisoners restored to their
respective homes.</p>

<p>The surgeon on board The Epervier succeeded at length in
taking out the ball lodged in Ethelston’s shoulder; and when
they arrived at Guadaloupe, he pronounced his patient out of
danger, but enjoined the strictest quiet and confinement, till
his recovery should be further advanced. The ardent young
L’Estrange no sooner reached home than he prevailed on his
father to receive Ethelston into his own house. He painted
to his sister Nina, a girl of seventeen, the sufferings and the
heroism of their guest in the most glowing colours; he made her
prepare for him the most refreshing and restoring beverages;
he watched for hours at the side of his couch; in short, he
lavished upon him all those marks of affection with which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
hasty and generous nature loves to make reparation for a
wrong. In all these attentions and endeavours, he was warmly
seconded by Nina, who made her brother repeat more than
once the narrative of the defence and subsequent loss of the
brig. How Ethelston’s recovery proceeded under the care of
the brother and sister shall be told in another chapter.</p>

<p class="pch">VISIT OF WINGENUND TO MOOSHANNE.—HE REJOINS WAR&ndash;EAGLE, AND
THEY RETURN TO THEIR BAND IN THE FAR WEST.—M. PERROT MAKES
AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON THE HEART OF A YOUNG LADY.</p>

<p class="pn">We must now return to Mooshanne, where Colonel Brandon
received Wingenund very kindly; and within half an hour of the
arrival of the party, they were all seated at his hospitable board,
whereon smoked venison steaks, various kinds of fowls, a substantial
ham, cakes of rice, and Indian maize. On the side&ndash;table
were cream, wild honey, cheese, and preserved fruits, all these
delicacies being admirably served under the superintendence of
Aunt Mary, who was delighted with Wingenund, praised the
extreme beauty of his eyes and features, telling the Colonel,
in a whisper, that if she had been thirty&ndash;five years younger,
she should have been afraid of losing her heart! The youth
was indeed the hero of the day: all were grateful to him for
his gallant preservation of Reginald’s life, and all strove with
equal anxiety to make him forget that he was among strangers.
Nor was the task difficult; for though he had only the use of
one hand, it was surprising to see the tact and self&ndash;possession
with which he conducted himself, the temperate quietness
with which he ate and drank, and the ease with which he
handled some of the implements at table, which he probably
saw for the first time. Baptiste was a privileged person
in the Colonel’s house, and was allowed to dine as he
pleased, either with its master, or with Perrot and the other
servants. On this occasion, he was present in the dining&ndash;room,
and seemed to take a pleasure in drawing out the
young Delaware, and in making him talk on subjects which
he knew would be interesting to the rest of the party.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Wingenund was quiet and reserved in his replies, except when
a question was put to him by Lucy, to whom he gave his
answers with the greatest <i>naïveté</i>, telling her more than once,
that she reminded him of his sister Prairie&ndash;bird, but that the
latter was taller, and had darker hair. Whilst addressing her,
he kept his large speaking eyes so riveted upon Lucy’s countenance,
that she cast her own to the ground, almost blushing
at the boy’s earnest and admiring gaze. To relieve herself
from embarrassment, she again inquired about this mysterious
sister, saying, “Tell me, Wingenund, has she taught you to
read, as well as to speak our tongue?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the youth; “Prairie&ndash;bird talks with the Great
Spirit, and with paper books, and so does the Black Father;
but Wingenund cannot understand them,—he is only a
poor Indian.”</p>

<p>Here Reginald, whose curiosity was much excited, inquired,
“Does the Prairie&ndash;bird look kindly on the young chiefs of the
tribe?—Will she be the wife of a chief?”</p>

<p>There was something both of surprise and scorn in Wingenund’s
countenance, as he replied, “Prairie&ndash;bird is kind to
all—the young chiefs find wives among the daughters of the
Delawares;—but the antelope mates not with the moose,
though they feed on the same Prairie. The Great Spirit
knows where the Prairie&ndash;bird was born! but her race is
unknown to the wise men among the Tortoises.”</p>

<p>Reginald and his sister were equally at a loss to understand
his meaning; both looked inquiringly at the guide, who was
rubbing his ear, as if rather puzzled by the young Delaware’s
answer. At length he said, “Why, Miss Lucy, you see,
much of what the lad says is as plain to me as the sight on
my rifle: for the tribes of the Lenapé are as well known to me
as the <i>totems</i> of the Oggibeways. The Great nation is divided
into three tribes:—the Minsi, or the Wolf&ndash;tribe (sometimes
called also Puncsit, or round&ndash;foot); the Unalacticos, or the
Turkey&ndash;tribe; and the <i>Unamis</i>, or the Tortoise&ndash;tribe. The
last are considered the principal and most ancient; and as
Wingenund’s family are of this band, he spoke just now of
their wise men. But who, or what kin’ o’ crittur this
Prairie&ndash;bird can be, would puzzle a Philadelphy lawyer to tell,
let alone a poor hunter who knows little out of the line of his
trade.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then, Baptiste,” said Lucy, smiling; “your trade is a
pretty extensive one, for I think you have more knowledge in
your head on most subjects than half the lawyers and clerks
in the territory.”</p>

<p>“There it is, Miss Lucy; you’re always a givin’ me a
little dose of flattery, just as I give my patches a bit of
grease to make the Doctor swallow his lead pills. You ladies
think we’re all alike,—young sparks, and tough old chaps
like me,—if you do but dip your fingers into the honey&ndash;pot,
you know we shall lick them as soon as your backs are turned!
But it is getting late,” he added, rising from his seat; “and
I have much to say to this youth, who is already tired; with
your leave, Miss, I will retire with him, and see that he has a
comfortable sleeping quarter, and that he wants for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Pray do so,” said Lucy; “let him be treated as if he
were one of our own family. I am sure, dear papa, such
would be your wish,” she added, turning to her father.</p>

<p>“It is indeed, my child,” said the Colonel. “Wingenund,
again I beg you to receive a father’s best thanks for your
brave defence of his son.”</p>

<p>“It was nothing,” replied the boy modestly. “You are
all good, too good to Wingenund; when he gets to the Far
Prairie, he will tell the Prairie&ndash;bird and the Black Father to
speak to the Great Spirit, that He may smile on my white
father and on my brother; and,” he added, slowly raising
his dark eloquent eyes to Lucy’s face, “that he may send
down pleasant sunshine and refreshing dew on the Lily of
Mooshanne.” So saying, he turned and left the room,
accompanied by the guide.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed the Colonel, as the youth disappeared,
“they may call that lad a savage; but his feelings, ay, and
his manners too, would put to shame those of many who
think themselves fine gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“He is, indeed, a noble young fellow,” said Reginald,
“and worthy to be the relative and pupil of my Indian
brother. I would that you had seen <i>him</i>, father: you are in
general rather sceptical as to the qualities of the red&ndash;skins. I
think the War&ndash;Eagle would surprise you!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Reginald,” said the Colonel, “I have seen among
them so much cruelty, cunning, and drunkenness, that the
romantic notions which I once entertained respecting them are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
completely dissipated. Nevertheless, I confess that many of
their worst faults have arisen from their commerce with the
whites; and they still retain some virtues which are extremely
rare among us.”</p>

<p>“To which do you allude?” inquired Reginald.</p>

<p>“More especially, to patience under suffering, a padlocked
mouth when entrusted with a secret, and unshaken fidelity
in friendship.”</p>

<p>“These are indeed high and valuable qualities,” replied
Reginald. “Moreover, it strikes me that in one principal
feature of character the Indian is superior to us; he acts up to
his creed. That creed may be entirely based on error; it may
teach him to prefer revenge to mercy, theft to industry,
violence to right; but such as he has learnt it from his
fathers, he acts up to it more firmly and consistently than we
do, ‘who know the right and still the wrong pursue.’”</p>

<p>“Your observation is just,” replied his father; “they are
benighted, and do many of the deeds of darkness. What
shall we say of those who do them under the light of a noonday
sun?”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said Lucy, “this Wingenund seems half a
Christian, and more than half a gentleman, either by nature,
or by the instructions of the strange being he calls the
Prairie&ndash;bird!”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Lucy,” said her brother, with a malicious
smile, “I thought, while the lad was speaking of his sister on
the Prairie, his eyes were strangely fixed upon the white lady in
the wigwam. It is fortunate he is going soon; and still more
fortunate that a certain cruising captain is not returned from
the West Indies.” As this impertinent speech was made in
a whisper, it did not reach Aunt Mary or the Colonel; and
the only reply it drew from Lucy, was a blushing threat of
a repetition of the same punishment which she had inflicted
in the morning for a similar offence. He begged pardon, and
was forgiven; soon after which the little party broke up and
retired to rest.</p>

<p>Meantime Baptiste, who knew that the well&ndash;intentioned
offer of a bed&ndash;room and its comforts would be a great annoyance
to Wingenund, took the lad out with him to a dry barn
behind the house, where there was an abundant supply of
clean straw, and where he intended to lodge him for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
night. “Wingenund,” said he, “you will rest here for some
hours; but we must go long before daylight to meet War&ndash;Eagle,
according to my promise.”</p>

<p>“I will be ready,” replied the youth; and casting himself
down on a bundle of straw, in five minutes his wounds and
fatigues were forgotten in a refreshing sleep, over which
hovered the bright dreams of youth, wherein the sweet tones
of his sister’s voice were confused with the blue eyes of Lucy;
and yet withal, a sleep such as guilt can never know, and the
wealth of the Indies cannot purchase.</p>

<p>Before three o’clock on the following morning, the guide
re&ndash;entered the barn with a light step; not so light, however,
as to escape the quick ear of the young Indian, who leapt
from his straw couch, and throwing his rifle over his shoulder,
stood before the hunter. “I hope you slept well,” said the
latter, “and that your arm gives you less pain?”</p>

<p>“I slept till you came,” said the boy, “and the pain sleeps
still. I feel nothing of it.”</p>

<p>“Wingenund will be like his father,” said the guide;
“he will laugh at pain and fatigue and danger; and his war&ndash;path
will be sprinkled with the blood of his enemies.”</p>

<p>The youth drew himself proudly up; and though gratified
by the guide’s observation, merely replied, “The Great Spirit
knows.—I am ready; let us go.”</p>

<p>Baptiste had provided a couple of horses, and they started
at a brisk pace, as he wished to reach the spot where he had
appointed to meet War&ndash;Eagle soon after daylight. To one
less familiar with the woods, the tangled and winding path
through which he led the way would have offered many impediments;
but Baptiste went rapidly forward without hesitation
or difficulty, Wingenund following in silence; and after a
brisk ride of three hours they came to an opening in the forest,
where a log&ndash;hut was visible, and beyond it the broad expanse
of Ohio’s stream.</p>

<p>The guide here whispered to Wingenund to remain concealed
in the thicket with the horses, whilst he reconnoitred
the hut; because he knew that it was sometimes used as a
shelter and a rendezvous by some of the lawless and desperate
characters on the borders of the settlements.</p>

<p>Having finished his examination, and ascertained that the
hut was empty, he returned to Wingenund, and desired him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to come down to the water’s edge, where he was to make a
signal for War&ndash;Eagle, who ought to be now at no great distance.
The youth accordingly went to the river’s bank, and
understanding from the guide that there was no occasion for
further concealment, he gave three whistles in a peculiar tone,
but exceedingly loud and shrill. For some time they listened
for a reply. Nothing was heard, except the beak of the woodpecker
upon the bark of the elm, and the notes of the various
feathered choristers chirping their matin song.</p>

<p>After a pause of several minutes, the guide said, “Surely
some accident has detained War&ndash;Eagle! Perhaps he has
failed in getting the canoe. Repeat the signal, Wingenund.”</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle is here,” replied the youth, who was quietly
leaning on his rifle, with an abstracted air.</p>

<p>Again, the guide listened attentively; and as he was unable
to distinguish the slightest sound indicative of the chief’s approach,
he was rather vexed at the superior quickness implied
in Wingenund’s reply, and said somewhat testily, “A moose
might hear something of him, or a bloodhound might find the
wind of him, but I can make out nothing, and my ears an’t
used to be stuffed with cotton, neither!”</p>

<p>“Grande&ndash;Hâche is a great warrior, and Wingenund would
be proud to follow in his war&ndash;path; eyes and ears are the
gift of the Great Spirit.”</p>

<p>“How know you that War&ndash;Eagle is here?” inquired the
guide impatiently.</p>

<p>“By that,” replied the boy, pointing to a scarcely perceptible
mark on the bank a few yards from his feet, “that is the
mocassin of the War&ndash;Eagle; he has been to the hut this
morning; below that foot&ndash;print you will see on the sand the
mark of where his canoe has touched the ground.”</p>

<p>“The boy is right,” muttered Baptiste, examining the
marks carefully. “I believe I am no hunter, but an ass after
all, with no better ears and eyes than Master Perrot, or any
other parlour&ndash;boarder.”</p>

<p>In a very few minutes the sound of the paddle was heard,
and War&ndash;Eagle brought his canoe to the bank; a brief conversation
now took place between him and Baptiste, in which
some particulars were arranged for Reginald’s visit to the Western
Prairie. The guide then taking from his wallet several
pounds of bread and beef, and a large parcel of tobacco, added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
these to the stores in the bottom of the canoe, and having
shaken hands heartily with the chief and Wingenund, returned
leisurely on his homeward way; but he still muttered to himself
as he went; and it was evident that he could not shake off
the annoyance which he felt at being “out&ndash;crafted,” as he
called it, “by a boy!”</p>

<p>We will not follow the tedious and toilsome voyage of War&ndash;Eagle
and his young friend in the canoe, a voyage in which,
after descending the Ohio, they had to make their way up the
Mississippi to its junction with the Missouri, and thence up
the latter river to the mouth of the Osage river, which they
also ascended between two and three hundred miles before they
rejoined their band. It is sufficient for the purposes of our tale
to inform the reader that they reached their destination in
safety, and that Wingenund recovered from the effects of his
severe wound.</p>

<p>When Baptiste returned to Mooshanne, he found the family
surprised and annoyed at the sudden disappearance of their
young Indian guest; but when he explained to Reginald that
he had gone to rejoin his chief by War&ndash;Eagle’s desire, Reginald
felt that the best course had been adopted, as the boy might, if
he had remained, have fallen in the way of the exasperated
party who were seeking to revenge Hervey’s death.</p>

<p>It was about noon when Mike Smith, and several of those
who accompanied him the preceding day, arrived at Mooshanne,
and insisted upon Baptiste showing them the spot where
he had told them that an Indian had been recently buried,
Reginald declined being of the party, which set forth under
the conduct of the guide, to explore the scene of the occurrences
mentioned in a former chapter.</p>

<p>During their absence, Reginald was lounging in his sister’s
boudoir, talking with her over the events of the preceding days,
when they heard the sound of a vehicle driven up to the door,
and the blood rushed into Lucy’s face as the thought occurred
to her that it might be Ethelston; the delusion was very brief,
for a moment afterwards the broad accent of David Muir was
clearly distinguishable, as he said to his daughter, “Noo, Jessie,
haud a grip o’ Smiler, whilst I gie a pull at the door&ndash;bell.”</p>

<p>Much to the surprise of the worthy “merchaunt” (by
which appellation David delighted to be designated), the door
was opened by no less a personage than Monsieur Gustave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Perrot himself, who seeing the pretty Jessie in her father’s
spring&ndash;cart, hastened with characteristic gallantry to assist her
to descend; in the performance of which operation he extended
both his hands to support her waist, saying, in his most
tender tone, “Take care, Miss Jessie; now shump, and trust
all your leetle weight with me.”</p>

<p>But while he was speaking, the active girl, putting one foot
on the step, and touching him lightly on the arm, stood on the
ground beside him.</p>

<p>“Weel, Mr. Parrot, and how’s a’ wi’ ye the day?” said David,
who was busily employed in extracting various packages and
parcels from the cart.</p>

<p>“All ver’ well, thank you, Mr. Muir; wonderful things
happen, though. My young Mr. Reginald he be drowned and
stabbed, and quite well!”</p>

<p>“Gude save us!” said David in horror; “drowned and
stabbed, and quite well! Ye’re surely no in earnest, Mr.
Parrot!”</p>

<p>“I speak only the truth always,—Miss Jessie, the fresh
air and the ride make your cheek beautiful rosy.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Perrot,” replied Jessie, smiling, “that is a poor compliment!
You are so gallant a gentleman, you should praise
the roses in a lady’s cheek without mentioning that she owes
them to a rough road and a fresh breeze!”</p>

<p>This dialogue on roses was here interrupted by David, who
said, “May be, Mr. Parrot, ye’ll just let Smiler be ta’en
round to the stable, and desire ane o’ the lads to help us in
with these twa parcels; yon muckle basket, there, is brimfull of
all the newest kick&ndash;shaws, and modes, as they call ‘em, frae Philadelphy;
so Jessie’s just come wi’ me to gie Miss Lucy the
first choice; and she’s a right to hae it too, for she’s the
bonniest and the best young lady in the territory.”</p>

<p>Mr. Perrot, having given these necessary orders, David,
with his papers, was soon closeted with the Colonel in his
business room; and Jessie was ushered into the young lady’s
boudoir, where her brother still sat, with the intention of
giving his sister the benefit of his advice in the selection of
what David called kick&ndash;shaws and modes for her toilet.
Meanwhile Perrot was preparing a formidable attack upon
Jessie’s heart, through the medium of some venison steaks, a
delicate ragout of squirrel, and sundry other tit&ndash;bits, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
he hoped to propitiate the village beauty. As Jessie entered
the room, her salutation of Lucy was modestly respectful; and
she returned Reginald’s bow with an unembarrassed and not
ungraceful courtesy. While she was drawing out and placing
on a table the silken contents of her basket, Reginald inquired
of her whether any news was stirring in Marietta.</p>

<p>“None,” replied she, “except the killing of Hervey. All
the town is speaking of it, and they say it will cause more
bloodshed; for Mike Smith vows, if he cannot find the real
offender, he’ll shoot down the first Indian he finds in the
woods.”</p>

<p>“Mike Smith is a hot&ndash;headed fool,” replied Reginald; but
remembering sundry reports which had reached his ear, he
added, “I beg your pardon, Miss Jessie, if the words give
you offence.”</p>

<p>“Indeed you have given none, Master Reginald,” said
Jessie, colouring a little at the implied meaning of his words;
“Mike comes very often to our store, but I believe it is more
for whiskey than any thing else.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Reginald; “I doubt you do him injustice.
They say he prefers the end of the store which is the furthest
from the bar.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he may,” replied Jessie; “I am always better
pleased when he stays away, for he is very ill&ndash;tempered and
quarrelsome! Well, Miss,” continued she, “are not these
pink ribbons beautiful, and these two light shawls,—they
come from the British East India House?”</p>

<p>“They are indeed the prettiest and most delicate that I ever
saw,” replied Lucy; “and see here, Reginald,” said she,
drawing him aside, “these French bead necklaces will do
famously for some of your Delaware friends.” She added in a
whisper, “Ask her if there is no other news at the town?”</p>

<p>“What about?” inquired her brother. A silent look of
reproach was her only reply, as she turned away, and again
busied herself with the silks. He was instantly conscious and
ashamed of his thoughtlessness, which, after a few moments’
silence, he proceeded to repair, saying, “Pray tell me, Miss
Jessie, has your father received no intelligence of The Pride of
the Ohio?”</p>

<p>“Alas! not a word,” replied the girl, in a tone of voice so
melancholy, that it startled them both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“But why speak you in so sad a voice about the vessel,
Jessie, if you have heard no bad news regarding her?” said
Reginald, quickly.</p>

<p>“Because, sir, she has been very long over&ndash;due, and there
are many reports of French ships of war; and we, that is, my
father, is much interested about her.”</p>

<p>Poor Lucy’s colour came and went; but she had not the
courage to say a word. After a short pause, Reginald inquired,
“Have any boats come up lately from New Orleans?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Henderson’s came up only a few days ago, and
Henry Gregson, who had been down on some business for my
father, returned in her.”</p>

<p>“That is the young man who assists your father in the
store? I believe he is a son of the mate on board The Pride.
I have remarked that he is a very fine&ndash;looking young fellow!”</p>

<p>“He is the son of Captain Ethelston’s mate,” said Jessie,
casting down her eyes, and busying herself with some of her
ribbons and silks. “But I hope,” continued she, “that you,
Mr. Reginald, are not seriously hurt. Mr. Perrot told me you
had been drowned and stabbed!”</p>

<p>“Not quite so bad as that,” said Reginald, laughing; “I
had, indeed, a swim in the Muskingum, and a blow from a
horse’s hoof, but am none the worse for either. Do not forget,
Miss Jessie, to send off a messenger immediately that any news
arrive of The Pride. You know what a favourite she is, and
how anxious we are here about her!”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will not forget,” replied Jessie.</p>

<p>Lucy sighed audibly; and after purchasing a few ribbons
and shawls, as well as a stock of beads for her brother, she
allowed Jessie to retire, begging, at the same time, her acceptance
of one of the prettiest shawls in her basket. As the
latter hesitated about receiving it, Lucy threw it over the
girl’s shoulder, saying playfully, “Nay, Jessie, no refusal; I
am mistress here; and nobody, not even Mr. Reginald, disputes
my will in this room.”</p>

<p>Jessie thanked the young lady, and saluting her brother,
withdrew to a back parlour, where Monsieur Perrot had already
prepared his good things, and where her father only
waited her coming to commence a dinner which his drive had
made desirable, and which his olfactory nerves told him was
more savoury than the viands set before him at Marietta by Mrs.
Christie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Call ye this a squirrel ragoo?” said the worthy merchaunt;
“weel now it’s an awfu’ thing to think how the Lord’s gifts
are abused in the auld country! I hae seen dizens o’ they
wee devils lilting and looping amaing the woods in the
Lothians; and yet the hungry chaps wha can scarce earn a
basin o’ porritch, or a pot o’ kail to their dinner, would as soon
think o’ eatin’ a stoat or a foumart!”</p>

<p>While making this observation, Davie was despatching the
“ragoo” with a satisfaction which showed how completely he
had overcome his insular prejudices. Nor were Perrot’s
culinary attentions altogether lost upon Miss Jessie; for although
she might not repay them entirely according to the
wishes of the gallant Maître d’Hôtel, she could not help
acknowledging that he was a pleasant good&ndash;humoured fellow,
and that his abilities as a cook were of the highest order.
Accordingly, when he offered her a foaming glass of cider, she
drank it to his health, with a glance of her merry eye sufficient
to have turned the head of a man less vain and amorous than
Monsieur Perrot.</p>

<p>The dinner passed pleasantly enough; and as David Muir
drove his daughter back to Marietta, his heart being warmed
and expanded by the generous cider (which, for the good of
his health, he had crowned with a glass of old rum), he said,
“Jessie, I’m thinking, that Maister Parrot is a douce and
clever man; a lassie might do waur than tak’ up wi’ the like o’
him! I’se warrant his nest will no be ill feathered!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” replied Jessie; and turning her head away,
she sighed, and thought of Henry Gregson.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND THAT THE COUCH OF AN INVALID
HAS PERILS NOT LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THOSE WHICH
ARE TO BE ENCOUNTERED AT SEA.</p>

<p class="pn">We left Ethelston stretched on a sick couch in Guadaloupe,
in the house of Captain L’Estrange, and tended by his daughter
Nina, and by her brother, the young lieutenant. The latter
grew daily more attached to the patient, who had been his
captor, and was now his prisoner; but he was obliged, as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
as Ethelston was pronounced out of danger, to sail for Europe,
as he was anxious to obtain that professional distinction which
his parole prevented his gaining in service against the United
States. And in France there seemed a promising harvest of
combat and of glory, sufficient to satisfy the martial enthusiasm
even of the most adventurous of her sons. When he sailed,
he again and again pressed upon his sister to bestow every
attention upon Ethelston; and as the Captain was much
busied with his command, and as Madame L’Estrange was
entirely devoted to her boudoir,—where, with two chattering
parrots to amuse her, and a little black girl to fan her while
listlessly poring over the pages of Florian in a fauteuil,—the
whole charge devolved upon the willing and kind&ndash;hearted Nina.
She was the third and youngest daughter of Monsieur and
Madame L’Estrange; but (her two elder sisters being married)
she was the only one resident with her parents.</p>

<p>Sixteen summers had now passed over her, and her disposition
was like that of her brother,—frank, impetuous, and
warm&ndash;hearted. Her feelings had never been guided or regulated
by her handsome but indolent mother; her mind had
been allowed to seek its food at hap&ndash;hazard among the
romances, poems, and plays upon the shelves in the drawing&ndash;room.
Her father spoilt and her brother petted her. A
governess also she had, whom she governed, and to whose
instructions she owed little, except a moderate proficiency in
music. Her countenance was a very beautiful mirror, reflecting
the warm and impassioned features of her character. Her
complexion was dark, though clear, and her hair black and
glossy. The pencilling of her eyebrows was exceedingly
delicate; and the eyes themselves were large, speaking, and
glowing with that humid lustre which distinguishes creole
beauty. Nothing could exceed the rosy fulness of her lip,
and the even whiteness of the teeth which her joyous smile
disclosed. Her figure was exquisitely proportioned; and her
every movement a very model of natural grace. She seemed,
indeed, impregnated with the fervour of the sunny climate in
which she had been reared; and her temper, her imagination,
her passions, all glowed with its ardent but dangerous warmth.
According to the usage of her country, she had been betrothed,
when a child, to a neighbouring planter, one of the richest in
the island; but as he was absent in Europe, and there remained
yet two years before the time fixed for the fulfilment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of the contract, she rarely troubled her head about the marriage
or her future destiny.</p>

<p>Such was the girl who now officiated as nurse to Ethelston,
and who, before she had seen him, had gathered from her
brother such traits of his character as had called forth all the
interest and sympathy of her romantic disposition. Although
not eminently handsome, we have before noted that his countenance
was manly and expressive, and his manners courteous
and engaging. Perhaps also the weakness, remaining after the
crisis of his fever, imparted to the usually gentle expression
of his features that touching attraction which is called by a
modern poet “a loving languor.” At all events, certain it is,
that ere poor Nina had administered the third saline draughd
to her grateful patient, her little heart beat vehemently; and
when she had attended his feverish couch one short week, she
was desperately in love!</p>

<p>How fared it in the meantime with Ethelston? Did his
heart run any risk from the dark eloquent eyes, and the gracefully
rounded form of the ministering angel who hovered
about his sick&ndash;room? At present none, for Lucy was shrined
there; and he had been taught by young L’Estrange to consider
his sister in the light of a nursery&ndash;girl, still under the
dominion of the governess.</p>

<p>Days and weeks elapsed, Ethelston’s recovery progressed,
and he was able to stroll in the shade of the orange and
citron groves which sheltered Captain L’Estrange’s villa to the
northward. Here, with his eyes fixed on the sea, would he
sometimes sit for hours, and devise schemes for returning to
his home. On these occasions he was frequently accompanied
by Nina, who walked by his side with her guitar in her hand;
and under the pretence of receiving instructions from him in
music, she would listen with delight, and hang with rapture
on every syllable that he uttered. Though he could not avoid
being sensible of her ripening beauty, his heart was protected
by the seven&ndash;fold shield of a deep and abiding attachment;
and as he still looked upon Nina as a lovely girl, completing
her education in the nursery, he gladly gave her all the assistance
that she asked under her musical difficulties; and this
he was able to do, from having made no small proficiency in
the science during his long residence in Germany.</p>

<p>Sometimes he paid his respects to Madame L’Estrange; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that lady was so indolent, and so exclusively devoted to her
parrots and her lap&ndash;dog, that his visits to her were neither
frequent nor of long duration. The Captain was very seldom
ashore; and thus Ethelston was obliged to spend his time
alone, or in the society of the young girl who had nursed him
so kindly during his illness. Her character seemed to have
undergone a sudden and complete change. The conquering
god, who had at first only taken possession of the outworks of
her fancy, had now made himself master of the citadel of her
heart. She loved with all the intense absorbing passion of a
nature that had never known control. The gaiety and buoyancy
of her spirits had given place to a still, deep flood of
feeling, which her reason never attempted to restrain. Even
when with <i>him</i> she spoke little. Her happiness was too intense
to find a vent in words; and thus she nursed and fed a flame,
that needed only the breath of accident to make it burst forth
with a violence that should burn up or overleap all the barriers
of self&ndash;control.</p>

<p>Nor must the reader imagine that Ethelston was dull or
blind, because he observed not the state of Nina’s affections.
His own were firmly rooted elsewhere; he was neither of a
vain nor a romantic disposition; and he had been duly
informed by Monsieur L’Estrange, that in the course of two
years Nina was to be married to Monsieur Bertrand, the
young planter, to whom, as we have before mentioned, she had
been betrothed by her parents since her thirteenth year. He
could not help seeing that, although her intellect was quick,
and her character enthusiastic, her education had been shamefully
neglected both by Madame L’Estrange and the governess.
Hence he spoke, counselled, and sometimes chid her, in the
tone of an elder brother, heedless of the almost imperceptible
line that separates friendship from love in the bosom of a girl
nurtured under a West Indian sun.</p>

<p>In this state were matters, when, on a fine evening, Ethelston
strolled alone into his favourite orange&ndash;grove, to look out
upon the ocean, and, in the enjoyment of its refreshing breeze,
to ruminate on his strange captivity, and revolve various plans
of escape.</p>

<p>Captain L’Estrange had paid a visit to his home on the
preceding day, and finding his prisoner so completely restored
to health and strength, had said to him, jokingly, “Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
fair sir, I think I must put you on your parole, or in chains;
for, after the character given of you by my son, I cannot allow
so dangerous a person to be at large during the continuance of
hostilities between our respective nations.”</p>

<p>Ethelston answered, half in earnest, and half in jest, “Nay,
sir, then I must wear the chains, for assuredly I cannot give
my parole; if an American vessel were to come in sight, or
any other means of flight to offer itself, depend upon it, in
spite of the kindness and hospitality I have met with here, I
should weigh anchor in a moment.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is a fair warning,” said the old Commodore;
“nevertheless I will not lock you up just yet, for I do not
think it very likely that any strange sail will come under the
guns of our fort; and I will run the risk of your flying
away on the back of a sea&ndash;gull.” Thus had they parted; and
the old gentleman was again absent on a cruise.</p>

<p>Ethelston was, as we have said, reclining listlessly under an
orange&ndash;tree, inhaling the cool breeze, laden with the fragrance
of its blossoms, now devising impossible plans of escape, and
now musing on a vision of Lucy’s graceful figure, gliding
among the deep woods around Mooshanne. As these thoughts
passed through his mind, they imparted a melancholy shade to
his brow, and a deep sigh escaped from his lips.</p>

<p>It was echoed by one yet deeper, close to his ear; and
starting from his reverie, he beheld Nina, who had approached
him unawares, and who, leaning on her guitar, had been for
the last few minutes gazing on his countenance with an absorbed
intensity, more fond and riveted than that with which
the miser regards his treasure, or the widowed mother her
only child.</p>

<p>When she found herself perceived, she came forward, and
covering her emotion under an assumed gaiety, she said,
“What is my kind instructor thinking of? He seems more
grave and sad than usual.”</p>

<p>“He is thinking,” said Ethelston, good&ndash;humouredly, “that
he ought to scold a certain young lady very severely for
coming upon him slily, and witnessing that gravity and sadness
in which a captive must sometimes indulge, but which
her presence has already dissipated.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Nina, still holding her guitar, and sitting
down on the bank near him; “you know that I am only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
obeying papa’s orders in watching you; for he says you
would not give your parole, and I am sure you were thinking
of your escape from Guadaloupe.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you might have guessed more wide of the mark,
Mademoiselle Nina,” said Ethelston.</p>

<p>“And are you then so very anxious to—to—see your
home again?” inquired Nina, hesitating.</p>

<p>“Judge for yourself, Nina,” he replied, “when I remind
you that for many months I have heard nothing of those who
have been my nearest and dearest friends from childhood;
nothing of the brave men who were captured with me when
our poor brig was lost!”</p>

<p>“Tell me about your friends and your home. Is it very
beautiful? Have you the warm sun, and the fresh sea&ndash;breeze,
and the orange&ndash;flowers, that we have here?”</p>

<p>“Scarcely,” replied Ethelston, smiling at the earnest rapidity
with which the beautiful girl based her inquiries on the
scene before her; “but we have in their place rivers, on the
bosom of which your father’s frigate might sail; groves and
woods of deep shade, impenetrable to the rays of the hottest
sun; and prairies smiling with the most brilliant and variegated
flowers.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how I should love to see that land!” exclaimed
Nina, her fervid imagination instantly grasping and heightening
its beauties. “How I should love to dwell there!”</p>

<p>“Nay, it appears to me not unlikely that you should at
some time visit it,” replied Ethelston. “This foolish war
between our countries will soon be over, and your father may
wish to see a region the scenery of which is so magnificent,
and which is not difficult of access from here.”</p>

<p>“Papa will never leave these islands, unless he goes to
France, and that he hates,” said Nina.</p>

<p>“Well then,” continued Ethelston, smiling, as he alluded
for the first time to her marriage, “you must defer your
American trip a year or two longer; then, doubtless, Monsieur
Bertrand will gladly gratify your desire to see the Mississippi.”</p>

<p>Nina started as if stung by an adder; the blood rushed
and mantled over her face and neck; her eyes glowed with
indignation, as she exclaimed, “I abhor and detest Monsieur
Bertrand. I would die before I would marry him!” Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
adding in a low voice, the sadness of which went to his heart,
“and this from you too!” She covered her face with her
hands and wept.</p>

<p>Never was man more astonished than Ethelston at the
sudden storm which he had inadvertently raised. Remembering
that Madame L’Estrange had told him of the engagement
as being known to Nina, he had been led to suppose
from her usual flow of spirits, that the prospect was far from
being disagreeable to her. Young L’Estrange had also told
him that Bertrand was a good looking man, of high character,
and considered, from his wealth, as the best match in the
French islands; so that Ethelston was altogether unprepared
for the violent aversion which Nina now avowed for the marriage,
and for the grief by which she seemed so deeply agitated.
Still he was as far as ever from divining the true cause of
her emotion, and conjectured that she had probably formed
an attachment to one of the young officers on board her
father’s ship. Under this impression he took her hand, and
sympathising with the grief of one so fair and so young, he
said to her kindly, “Forgive me, Nina, if I have said any
thing to hurt your feelings; indeed I always have believed
that your engagement to Monsieur Bertrand was an affair
settled by your parents entirely with your consent. I am sure
Monsieur L’Estrange loves his favourite child too well to compel
her to a marriage against her inclination. Will you permit
your Mentor (as you have more than once allowed me to call
myself) to speak with him on the subject?”</p>

<p>Nina made no reply, and the tears coursed each other yet
faster down her cheek.</p>

<p>“Your brother is absent,” continued Ethelston; “you
seem not to confide your little secrets to your mother—will
you not let me aid you by my advice? I am many years
older than you.—I am deeply grateful for all your kindness
during my tedious illness; believe me, I will, if you will only
trust me, advise you with the affectionate interest of a parent,
or an elder brother.”</p>

<p>The little hand trembled violently in his, but still no reply
escaped from Nina’s lips.</p>

<p>“If you will not tell me your secret,” pursued Ethelston,
“I must guess it. Your aversion to the engagement arises not
so much from your dislike to Monsieur Bertrand, as from your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
preference of some other, whom perhaps your parents would not
approve?”</p>

<p>The hand was withdrawn, being employed in an ineffectual
attempt to check her tears. The slight fillet which bound her
black tresses had given way, and they now fell in disorder,
veiling the deep crimson glow which again mantled over the
neck of the weeping girl.</p>

<p>Ethelston gazed on her with emotions of deep sympathy.
There was a reality, a dignity about her speechless grief, that
must have moved a sterner heart than his; and as he looked
upon the heaving of her bosom, and upon the exquisite proportions
unconsciously developed in her attitude, he suddenly
felt that he was speaking, not to a child in the nursery, but
to a girl in whose form and heart the bud and blossom of
womanhood were thus early ripened. It was, therefore, in a
tone, not less kind, but more respectful than he had hitherto
used, that he said, “Nay, Nina, I desire not to pry into your
secrets—I only wish to assure you of the deep sympathy
which I feel with your sorrow, and of my desire to aid or
comfort you by any means within my power; but if my curiosity
offends you, I will retire, in the hope that your own gentle
thoughts may soon afford you relief.”</p>

<p>Again the little hand was laid upon his arm, as Nina, still
weeping, whispered, “No, no,—you do not offend me.—Do
not leave me, I entreat you!”</p>

<p>A painful silence ensued; and Ethelston, more than ever
confirmed in the belief that she had bestowed her affections on
some young middy, or lieutenant, under her father’s command,
continued, in a tone which he attempted to render gay: “Well
then, Nina, since you will not give your confidence to Mentor,
he must appoint himself your confessor; and to commence,
is he right in believing that your dislike to Monsieur Bertrand
arises from your having given your heart elsewhere?”</p>

<p>There was no reply; but her head was bowed in token of
acquiescence!</p>

<p>“I need not inquire,” pursued he, “whether the object of
your choice is, in rank and character, worthy of your affection?”</p>

<p>In an instant the drooping head was raised, and the dark
tresses thrown back from her brow, as, with her eyes flashing
through the moisture by which they were still bedewed, Nina
replied, “Worthy!—worthy the affection of a queen!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Ethelston, startled by her energy, was about to resume his
inquiries, when Nina, whose excited spirit triumphed for the
moment over all restraint, stopped him, saying, “I will spare
you the trouble of further questions. I will tell you freely,
that till lately, very lately, I cared for none.—Monsieur Bertrand
and all others were alike to me; but fate threw a stranger
in my path.—He was a friend of my brother;—he was
wounded.—For hours and hours I watched by his couch;—he
revived;—his looks were gentle; his voice was music.—I
drew counsel from his lips;—he filled my thoughts, my
dreams, my heart, my being! But he—he considered me
only as a silly child;—he understood not my heart;—he
mocked my agony;—he saved my brother’s life,—and is
now accomplishing the sister’s death!”</p>

<p>The excitement which supported Nina during the commencement
of this speech gradually died away. Towards its
close, her voice grew tremulous, and as the last words escaped
her quivering lips, exhausted nature gave way under the burden
of her emotion, and she fainted!</p>

<p>The feelings of Ethelston may be better imagined than
described. As the dreadful import of the poor girl’s words
gradually broke upon him, his cheeks grew paler and paler;
and when, at their conclusion, her senseless form lay extended
at his feet, the cold dew of agony stood in drops upon his
forehead! But Nina’s condition demanded immediate aid and
attention. Mastering himself by a powerful effort, he snatched
a lemon from a neighbouring tree; he cut it in half, and
sustaining the still insensible girl, he chafed her hands, and
rubbed her temples with the cool refreshing juice of the fruit.
After a time, he had the consolation of seeing her restored
gradually to her senses; and a faint smile came over her countenance
as she found herself supported by his arm. Still she
closed her eyes, as if in a happy dream, which Ethelston could
not bring himself to disturb; and, as the luxuriant black
tresses only half veiled the touching beauty of her countenance,
he groaned at the reflection that he had inadvertently been the
means of shedding the blight of unrequited love on a budding
flower of such exquisite loveliness. A long silence ensued,
softened, rather than interrupted, by the low wind as it whispered
through the leaves of the orange&ndash;grove; while the surrounding
landscape, and the wide expanse of ocean, glowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
with the red golden tints of the parting sun. No <i>unplighted</i>
heart could have resisted all the assailing temptations of that
hour. But Ethelston’s heart was not unplighted; and the
high principle and generous warmth of his nature served only
to deepen the pain and sadness of the present moment. He
formed, however, his resolution; and as soon as he found that
Nina was restored to consciousness, and to a certain degree of
composure, he gently withdrew the arm which had supported
her, and said, in a voice of most melancholy earnestness,
“Dear Nina! I will not pretend to misunderstand what you
have said. I have much to tell you; but I have not now
enough command over myself to speak, while you are still too
agitated to listen. Meet me here to&ndash;morrow at this same
hour; meanwhile, I entreat you, recall those harsh and unkind
thoughts which you entertained of me; and believe me, dear,
dear sister, that I would, rather than have mocked your feelings,
have died on that feverish couch, from which your care
revived me.” So saying, he hastened from her presence in a
tumult of agitation scarcely less than her own.</p>

<p>For a long time she sat motionless, in a kind of waking
dream; his parting words yet dwelt in her ear, and her passionate
heart construed them now according to its own wild
throbbings, now according to its gloomiest fears. “He has
much to tell me,” mused she; “he called me dear Nina; he
spoke not in a voice of indifference; his eye was full of a
troubled expression that I could not read. Alas! alas, ‘twas
only pity! He called me ‘dear sister!’—what can he
mean?—Oh that to&ndash;morrow were come! I shall not outlive
the night unless I can believe that he loves me!” And then
she fell again into a reverie; during which all the looks and
tones that her partial fancy had interpreted, and her too faithful
memory had treasured, were recalled, and repeated in a thousand
shapes; until, exhausted by her agitation, and warned
by the darkness of the hour, Nina retired to her sleepless
couch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ethelston, when he found himself alone in his
room, scrutinised with the most unsparing severity his past
conduct, endeavouring to remember every careless or unheeded
word by which he could have awakened or encouraged her
unsuspected affection. He could only blame himself that he
had not been more observant; that he had considered Nina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
too much in the light of a child; and had habitually spoken
to her in a tone of playful and confidential familiarity. Thus,
though his conscience acquitted him of the most remote intention
of trifling with her feelings, he accused himself of having
neglected to keep a watchful guard over his language and
behaviour, and resolved, at the risk of incurring her anger or
her hatred, to tell her firmly and explicitly on the morrow,
that he could not requite her attachment as it deserved, his
heart having been long and faithfully devoted to another.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">NARRATING THE TRIALS AND DANGERS THAT BESET ETHELSTON; AND
HOW HE ESCAPED FROM THEM, AND FROM THE ISLAND OF GUADALOUPE.</p>

<p class="pn">The night succeeding the occurrences related in the last
chapter brought little rest to the pillow either of Nina or of
Ethelston; and on the following day, as if by mutual agreement,
they avoided each other’s presence, until the hour
appointed for their meeting again in the orange&ndash;grove. Ethelston
was firmly resolved to explain to her unreservedly his
long engagement to Lucy, hoping that the feelings of Nina
would prove, in this instance, rather impetuous than permanent.
The tedious day appeared to her as if it never would
draw to a close. She fled from her mother, and from the
screaming parrots; she tried the guitar, but it seemed tuneless
and discordant; her pencil and her book were by turns
taken up, and as soon laid aside; she strolled even at midday
into the orange&ndash;grove, to the spot where she had last sat by
him, and a blush stole over her cheek when she remembered
that she had been betrayed into an avowal of her love; and
then came the doubt, the inquiry, whether he felt any love
for her? Thus did she muse and ponder, until the hours,
which in the morning had appeared to creep so slowly over
the face of the dial, now glided unconsciously forward. The
dinner&ndash;hour had passed unheeded; and before she had summoned
any of the courage and firmness which she meant to
call to her aid, Ethelston stood before her. He was surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
at finding Nina on this spot, and had approached it long
before the appointed time, in order that he might prepare
himself for the difficult and painful task which he had undertaken.
But though unprepared, his mind was of too firm and
regulated a character to be surprised out of a fixed determination;
and he came up and offered his hand to Nina, greeting
her in his accustomed tone of familiar friendship. She received
his salutation with evident embarrassment; her hand
and her voice trembled, and her bosom throbbed in a tumult
of anxiety and expectation. Ethelston saw that he could not
defer the promised explanation; and he commenced it with
his usual gentleness of manner, but with a firm resolve that he
would be honest and explicit in his language. He began by
referring to his long illness, and, with gratitude, to her care
and attention during its continuance; he assured her, that
having been told both by Madame L’Estrange and her brother,
that she was affianced to Monsieur Bertrand, he had accustomed
himself to look on her as a younger sister; and, as such,
had ventured to offer her advice and instruction in her studies.
He knew not, he dreamt not, that she could ever look upon
him in any other light than that of a Mentor.</p>

<p>Here he paused a moment, and continued in a deeper
and more earnest tone “Nina—dear Nina, we <i>must</i> be as
Mentor and his pupil to each other, or we must part. I
will frankly lay my heart open to you. I will conceal
nothing; then you will not blame me, and will, I hope,
permit me to remain your grateful friend and brother. Nina,
I am not blind either to your beauty, or to the many, many
graces of your disposition. I do full justice to the warmth
and truth of your affections: you deserve, when loved, to be
loved with a whole heart—“</p>

<p>“O spare this!” interrupted Nina, in a hurried whisper:
“Spare this, speak of yourself!”</p>

<p>“I was even about to do so,” continued Ethelston; “but,
Nina, such a heart I have not to give. For many months
and years, before I ever saw or knew you, I have loved, and
still am betrothed to another.”</p>

<p>A cold shudder seemed to pass through Nina’s frame
while these few words were spoken, as if in a moment the
health, the hope, the blossom of her youth were blighted!
Not a tear, not even a sob, gave relief to her agony; her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
bloodless lip trembled in a vain attempt to speak she knew
not what, and a burning chill sat upon her heart. These
words may appear to some strange and contradictory: happy,
thrice happy, ye to whom they so appear! If you have
never known what it is to feel at once a scorching heat parching
the tongue, and drying up all the well&ndash;springs of life
within, while a leaden weight of ice seems to benumb the
heart, then have you never known the sharpest, extreme
pangs of disappointed love!</p>

<p>Ethelston was prepared for some sudden and violent expression
on the part of Nina, but this death&ndash;like, motionless
silence almost overpowered him. He attempted, by the
gentlest and the kindest words, to arouse her from this
stupor of grief. He took her hand; its touch was cold.
Again and again he called her name; but her ear seemed
insensible, even to his voice. At length, unable to bear the
sight of her distress, and fearful that he might no longer
restrain his tongue from uttering words which would be treason
to his first and faithful love, he rushed into the house, and
hastily informing Nina’s governess that her pupil had been
suddenly taken ill in the orange&ndash;grove, he locked himself in
his room, and gave vent to the contending emotions by which
he was oppressed.</p>

<p>It was in vain that he strove to calm himself by the reflection
that he had intentionally transgressed none of the demands
of truth and honour;—it was in vain that he called
up all the long&ndash;cherished recollections of his Lucy and his
home;—still the image of Nina would not be banished; now
presenting itself as he had seen her yesterday, in the full glow
of passion, and in the full bloom of youthful beauty,—and
now, as he had just left her, in the deadly paleness and fixed
apathy of despair. The terrible thought that, whether guiltily
or innocently, he had been the cause of all this suffering in
one to whom he owed protection and gratitude, wrung his
heart with pain that he could not repress; and he found relief
only in falling on his knees, and praying to the Almighty that
the sin might not be laid to his charge, and that Nina’s sorrow
might be soothed and comforted by Him, who is the God of
consolation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the governess had, with the assistance of two of
the negro attendants, brought Nina into the house. The poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
girl continued in the same state of insensibility to all that
was passing around; her eyes were open, but she seemed to
recognise no one, and a few vague indistinct words still trembled
on her lips.</p>

<p>The doctor was instantly summoned, who pronounced, as
soon as he had seen his patient, that she was in a dangerous
fit, using sundry mysterious expressions about “febrile symptoms,”
and “pressure on the brain,” to which the worthy leech
added shakings of the head yet more mysterious.</p>

<p>For many days her condition continued alarming; the
threatened fever came, and with it a protracted state of
delirium. During this period Ethelston’s anxiety and agitation
were extreme; and proportionate was the relief that he
experienced, when he learnt that the crisis was past, and
that the youthful strength of her constitution promised speedy
recovery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had to endure the oft&ndash;repeated inquiries of
the governess, “How he happened to find Mademoiselle just
as the fit came on?” and of Madame L’Estrange, “How it
was possible for Nina to be attacked by so sudden an illness,
while walking in the orange&ndash;grove?”</p>

<p>When she was at length pronounced out of danger, Ethelston
again began to consider various projects for his meditated
escape from the island. He had more than once held communication
with his faithful Cupid on the subject, who was
ready to brave all risks in the service of his master; but the
distance which must be traversed before they could expect to
find a friendly ship or coast, seemed to exclude all reasonable
hope of success.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to follow and portray the thousand
changes that came over Nina’s spirit during her recovery. She
remembered but too well the words that Ethelston had last
spoken: at one moment she called him perfidious, ungrateful,
heartless; then she chid herself for railing at him, and
loaded his name with every blessing, and the expression of the
fondest affection: now she resolved that she would never see
nor speak to him more; then she thought that she must see
him, if it were only to show how she had conquered her weakness.
Amidst all these contending resolutions, she worked
herself into the belief that Ethelston had deceived her; and
that, because he thought her a child, and did not love her, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
had invented the tale of his previous engagement to lessen her
mortification. This soon became her settled conviction; and
when it crossed her mind, she would start with passion and
exclaim, “He shall yet love me, and me alone!”</p>

<p>The only confidant of her love was a young negress, who
waited upon her, and who was indeed so devoted to her that
she would have braved the Commodore’s utmost wrath, or
perilled her life, to execute her mistress’ commands.</p>

<p>It happened one evening that this girl, whose name was
Fanchette, went out to gather some fruit in the orange&ndash;grove;
and while thus employed she heard the voice of some one
speaking. On drawing nearer to the spot whence the sound
proceeded, she saw Ethelston sitting under the deep shade of
a tree, with what appeared a book before him.</p>

<p>Knowing that Nina was still confined to her room, he had
resorted hither to consider his schemes without interruption,
and was so busily employed in comparing distances, and calculating
possibilities, on the map before him, that Fanchette
easily crept to a place whence she could, unperceived, overhear
and observe him. “I must and will attempt it,” he muttered
aloud to himself; “we must steal a boat. Cupid and I can
manage it between us; my duty and my love both forbid my
staying longer here: with a fishing&ndash;boat we might reach
Antigua or Dominica, or at all events chance to fall in with an
American or a neutral vessel. Poor dear Nina,” he added, in
a lower tone. “Would to God I had never visited this shore!
<i>this</i>,” he continued, drawing a locket from his breast, “this
treasured remembrance of one far distant has made me proof
against thy charms, cold to thy love, but not, as Heaven is my
witness, unmoved or insensible to thy sufferings.” So saying
he relapsed into silent musing; and as he replaced the locket,
Fanchette crept noiselessly from her concealment, and ran to
communicate to her young mistress her version of what she
had seen. Being very imperfectly skilled in English, she
put her own construction upon those few words which she
had caught, and thought to serve Nina best by telling her
what she would most like to hear. Thus she described to
her how Ethelston had spoken to himself over a map; how
he had mentioned islands to which he would sail; how he
had named her name with tenderness, and had taken something
from his vest to press it to his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Nina listened in a tumult of joy; her passionate
heart would admit no doubting suggestion of her reason.
She was too happy to bear even the presence of Fanchette,
and rewarding her for her good news by the present of a
beautiful shawl which she wore at the moment, pushed the
delighted little negress out of the room, and threw herself
on her couch, where she repeated a hundred times that <i>he</i>
had been to her orange&ndash;grove, where they had last parted,
had named her name with tenderness, had pressed some token
to his lips—what could that be? It might be a flower,
a book, any thing—it mattered not—so long as she only
knew he loved her! Having long wept with impassioned
joy, she determined to show herself worthy of his love; and
the schemes which she formed, and resolved to carry into
effect, evinced the wild force and energy of her romantic
character. Among her father’s slaves was one who, being
a steady and skilful seaman, had the charge of a schooner
(originally an American prize), which lay in the harbour,
and which the Commodore sometimes used as a pleasure&ndash;yacht,
or for short trips to other parts of the island: this
man (whose name was Jacques) was not only a great favourite
with the young lady, but was also smitten with the black
eyes and plump charms of M’amselle Fanchette, who thus
exercised over him a sway little short of absolute. Nina
having held a conference with her abigail, sent for Jacques,
who was also admitted to a confidential consultation, the
result of which, after&ndash;occurrences will explain to the reader.
When this was over, she acquired, rather than assumed, a
sudden composure and cheerfulness: the delights of a plot
seemed at once to restore her to health; and on the following
day she sent to request that Ethelston would come
to see her in her boudoir, where she received him with a
calmness and self&ndash;possession for which he was altogether
unprepared. “Mr. Ethelston,” said she, as soon as he was
seated, “I believe you still desire to escape from your prison,
and that you are devising various plans for effecting
that object; you will never succeed unless you call me into
your counsel.”</p>

<p>Ethelston, though extremely surprised at the composure of
her manner and language, replied with a smile, “M’amselle
Nina, I will not deny that you have rightly guessed my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
thoughts; but as your father is my jailor, I did not dare to
ask your counsel in this matter.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Mentor,” said the wayward girl, “how does
your wisdom propose to act without my counsel?”</p>

<p>“I confess I am somewhat at a loss,” said Ethelston, good&ndash;humouredly;
“I must go either through the air or the water;
and the latter, being my proper element, is the path which I
would rather attempt.”</p>

<p>“And what should you think of me, if I were to play the
traitoress, and aid you in eluding the vigilance of my father,
and afford the means of escape to so formidable an enemy?”</p>

<p>Ethelston was completely puzzled by this playful tone of
banter, in one whom he had last seen under a paroxysm of
passion, and in whose dark eye there yet lurked an expression
which he could not define; but he resolved to continue the
conversation in the same spirit, and replied, “I would not
blame you for this act of filial disobedience; and though no
longer your father’s prisoner, I would, if I escaped, ever remain
his friend.”</p>

<p>“And would you show no gratitude to the lady who effected
your release?”</p>

<p>“I owe her already more—far more, than I can pay; and,
for this last crowning act of her generosity and kindness, I
would—“</p>

<p>As he hesitated, she inquired, abruptly, “You would what,
Ethelston?” For a moment she had forgotten the part she
was acting; and both the look that accompanied these words,
and the tone in which they were pronounced, reminded him
that he stood on the brink of a volcanic crater.</p>

<p>“I would give her any proof of my gratitude that she
would deign to accept, yes <i>any</i>,” he repeated earnestly, “even
to life itself, knowing that she is too noble and generous to
accept aught at my hands which faith and honour forbid me to
offer.”</p>

<p>Nina turned aside for a moment, overcome by her emotion;
but recovering herself quickly, she added, in her former tone
of pleasantry, “She will not impose any hard conditions; but
to the purpose; has your sailor&ndash;eye noticed a certain little
schooner anchored in the harbour?”</p>

<p>“What!” said Ethelston, eagerly, “a beautiful craft, of
about twenty tons, on the other side of the bay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Even the same.”</p>

<p>“Surely I have! She is American built, and swims like a
duck.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” replied Nina, “I think I shall do no great
harm in restoring her to an American! How many men
should you require to manage her?”</p>

<p>“I could sail her easily with one able seaman, besides my
black friend Cupid.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Nina, “I propose to lend her to you; you
may send her back at your convenience; and I will also provide
you an able seaman: write me a list of the stores and articles
which you will require for the trip, and send it me in an
hour’s time: prepare your own baggage, and be ready upon
the shortest notice. It is now my turn to command, and yours
to obey. Good&ndash;b’ye, Mr. Mentor.” So saying, she kissed her
hand to him, and withdrew.</p>

<p>Ethelston rubbed his eyes as if he did not believe their
evidence. “Could this merry, ready&ndash;witted girl be the same
as the Nina whom he had seen, ten days before, heart&ndash;broken,
and unable to conceal or repress the violence of her passion?”
The longer he mused, the more was he puzzled; and he came
at length to a conclusion at which many, more wise and more
foolish than himself, had arrived, that a woman’s mind, when
influenced by her affections, is a riddle hard to be solved. He
had not, however, much time for reflection, and being resolved
at all risks to escape from the island, he hastened to his room,
and, within the hour specified by Nina, sent her a list of the
stores and provisions for the voyage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fanchette had not been idle: she had painted to
Jacques, in the liveliest colours, the wealth, beauty, and freedom
of the distant land of Ohio, artfully mingling with this
description promises and allurements which operated more
directly on the feelings of her black swain; so that the latter,
finding himself entreated by Fanchette, and commanded by
his young mistress, hesitated no longer to betray his trust, and
desert the Commodore.</p>

<p>Ethelston, having communicated the prosperous state of
affairs to Cupid, and desired him to have all ready for immediate
escape, hastened to obey another summons sent to him
by Nina. He found her in a mood no less cheerful than before;
and although she purposely averted her face, a smile, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
meaning of which he could not define, played round the corner
of her expressive mouth. Though really glad to escape homeward,
and disposed to be grateful to Nina for her aid, he could
not help feeling angry and vexed at the capricious eagerness
with which she busied herself in contriving the departure of
one to whom she had so lately given the strongest demonstration
of tenderness; and although his heart told him that he could
not love her, there was something in this easy and sudden
withdrawal of her affection which wounded that self&ndash;love from
which the best of men are not altogether free. These feelings
gave an unusual coldness and constraint to his manner, when
he inquired her further commands.</p>

<p>To this question Nina replied by saying, “Then, Mr.
Ethelston, you are quite resolved to leave us, and to risk all
the chances and perils of this voyage?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” he replied: “it is my wish, my duty, and my
firm determination; and I entered the room,” he added, almost
in a tone of reproof, “desirous of repeating to you my thanks
for your kind assistance.”</p>

<p>Nina’s countenance changed; but, still averting it from
Ethelston, she continued in a lower voice, “And do you leave
us without pain—without regret?”</p>

<p>There was a tremor, a natural feeling in the tone in which
she uttered these few words, that recalled to his mind all that
he had seen her suffer, and drove from it the harsh thoughts
which he had begun to entertain; and he answered, in a voice
from which his self&ndash;command could not banish all traces
of emotion, “Dear Nina, I shall leave you with regret that
would amount to misery, if I thought that my visit had
brought any permanent unhappiness into this house. I desire
to leave you as a Mentor should leave a beloved pupil—as a
brother leaves a sister; with a full hope, that when I am gone,
you will fulfil your parents’ wishes, your own auspicious
destinies, and that, after years and years of happiness among
those whom Fate has decreed to be the companions of your
life, you will look back upon me as upon a faithful adviser of
your youth,—an affectionate friend, who——“</p>

<p>Nina’s nerves were not strung for the part she had undertaken:
gradually her countenance had grown pale as marble;
a choking sensation oppressed her throat; and she sunk in a
chair, sobbing, rather than uttering, the word, “Water.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
It was fortunately at hand; and having placed it in a glass by
her side, Ethelston retired to the window to conceal his own
emotion, and to allow time for that of Nina to subside.</p>

<p>After a few minutes she recovered her self&ndash;possession; and
although still deadly pale, her voice was distinct and firm, as
she said, “Ethelston, I am ashamed of this weakness; but it
is over: we will not speak of the past, and will leave to Fate
the future. Now listen to me: all the arrangements for
your departure will be complete by to&ndash;morrow evening. At
an hour before midnight, a small boat, with one man, will be
at the Quai du Marché, below the Place St. Louis. It is far
from the fort, and there is no sentry near the spot: you can
then row to the vessel and depart. But is it not too dangerous?”
she added. “Can you risk it? for the wind
whistles terribly, and I fear the approach of a hurricane!”</p>

<p>Ethelston’s eye brightened as he replied, “A rough night
is the fairest for the purpose, Nina.”</p>

<p>“Be it so,” she replied. “Now, in return for all that I
have done for you, there is only one favour I have to ask at
your hands.”</p>

<p>“Name it,” said Ethelston, eagerly.</p>

<p>“There is,” she continued, “a poor sick youth in the
town, the child of respectable parents in New Orleans; he
desires to go home, if it be only to die there: and a nurse
will take care of him on the passage, if you will let him go
with you?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly I will,” said Ethelston; “and will take as
much care of him as if he were my brother.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Nina, “they tell me he is ordered to be perfectly
quiet, and no one attends him but the nurse; neither
will he give any trouble, as the coxswain says there is a small
cabin where he can remain alone and undisturbed.”</p>

<p>“You may depend,” said Ethelston, “that all your orders
about him shall be faithfully performed; and I will see, if I
live, that he reaches his home in safety.”</p>

<p>“He and his nurse will be on board before you,” said
Nina; “and as soon as you reach the vessel, you have
nothing to do but to escape as quick as you can. Now I must
bid you farewell! I may not have spirits to see you again!”
She held out her hand to him; it was cold as ice; her face
was still half&ndash;averted, and her whole frame trembled violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Ethelston took the offered hand, and pressed it to his lips,
saying, “A thousand, thousand thanks for all your kindness!
If I reach home alive I will make your honoured father ample
amends for the theft of his schooner; and if ever you have
an opportunity to let me know that you are well and happy,
do not forget that such news will always gladden my heart.”
He turned to look at her as he went; he doubted whether
the cold rigid apathy of her form and countenance was that
of despair or of indifference; but he dared not trust himself
longer in her presence; and as he left the room she sunk on
the chair against which she had been leaning for support.</p>

<p>When Ethelston found himself alone, he collected his
thoughts, and endeavoured in vain to account for the strange
deportment of Nina in bidding him farewell. The coldness of
her manner, the abrupt brevity of her parting address, had
surprised him; and yet the tremor, the emotion, amounting
almost to fainting, the forced tone of voice in which she had
spoken, all forbad him to hope that she had overcome her unhappy
passion; he was grieved that he had scarcely parted from
her in kindness; and the pity with which he regarded her was,
for the moment, almost akin to love.</p>

<p>Shaking off this temporary weakness, he employed himself
forthwith in the preparations for his departure: among the
first of which was a letter, which he wrote to Captain
L’Estrange, and left upon his table. On the following day
he never once saw Nina; but he heard from one of the
slaves that she was confined to her room by severe headache.</p>

<p>The wind blew with unabated force, the evening was dark
and lowering, as, at the appointed hour, Ethelston, accompanied
by his faithful Cupid, left the house with noiseless step.
They reached the boat without obstruction; pushed off, and
in ten minutes were safe on deck: the coxswain whispered
that all was ready; the boat was hoisted up, the anchor
weighed, and the schooner was soon dashing the foam from her
bows on the open sea.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">WHAT TOOK PLACE AT MOOSHANNE DURING THE STAY OF ETHELSTON
IN GUADALOUPE.—DEPARTURE OF REGINALD FOR THE FAR&ndash;WEST.</p>

<p class="pn">While the events related in the last two chapters occurred
at Guadaloupe, Reginald was busily employed at Mooshanne
in completing the preparations for his projected visit to the
Delawares, in the Far&ndash;west; he had (by putting in practice
the instructions given him by War&ndash;Eagle respecting Nekimi)
at length succeeded in gaining that noble animal’s affection;
he neighed at Reginald’s approach, knew and obeyed his
voice, fed from his hand, and received and returned his caresses,
as he had before done those of his Indian master. It was
when mounted on Nekimi that our hero found his spirit most
exulting and buoyant; he gave him the rein on the broadest
of the neighbouring prairies, and loved to feel the springy fleetness
and untiring muscles of this child of the western desert.
Sometimes, after a gallop of many miles, he would leap from
the saddle, to look with pride and pleasure on the spirited eye,
the full veins, the expanded nostril of his favourite; at other
times he would ride him slowly through the most tangled and
difficult ground, admiring the instinctive and unerring sagacity
with which he picked his way.</p>

<p>Among Reginald’s other accomplishments, he had learnt in
Germany to play not unskilfully on the horn; and constantly
carrying his bugle across his shoulders, Nekimi grew so accustomed
to the sound, that he would come to it from any distance
within hearing of its call. It appeared to Reginald so
probable that the bugle might render him good service on his
summer excursion, that he not only practised his horse to it,
but he prevailed on Baptiste to learn his various signals, and
even to reply on another horn to some of the simplest of them.
The honest guide’s first attempts to sound the bugle were ludicrous
in the extreme; but he good&ndash;humouredly persevered,
until Reginald and he could, from a considerable distance,
exchange many useful signals agreed upon between them, and
of course intelligible to none but themselves. Among these
were the following: “Beware!”—“Come to me,”—“Be
still,”—“Bring my horse,” and one or two others for hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
purposes, such as “A bear!”—“Buffalo!” To these
they added a reply, which was always to signify “I understand.”
But if the party called was prevented from obeying,
this signal was to be varied accordingly.</p>

<p>At the same time Reginald did not omit to learn from the
guide a number of Delaware words and phrases, in order that
when he arrived among his new friends he might not be altogether
excluded from communication with such of them as
should not understand English; in these preparations, and
occasional hunts in company with Baptiste, his time would
have glided on agreeably enough, had he not observed with
anxiety the settled melancholy that was gradually creeping
over his sister Lucy. It was in vain that he strove to comfort
her by reminding her of the thousand trifling accidents that
might have detained Ethelston in the West Indies, and have
prevented his letters from reaching home. She smiled upon
him kindly for his well&ndash;meant endeavours, and not only abstained
from all complaint, but tried to take her part in conversation;
yet he saw plainly that her cheerfulness was forced,
and that secret sorrow was at her heart. She employed herself
assiduously in tending her mother, whose health had of
late become exceedingly precarious, and who was almost always
confined to her apartments. Lucy worked by her side, conversed
with her, read to her, and did all in her power to hide
from her the grief that possessed her own bosom. Reginald
marked the struggle, which strengthened, if possible, the love
that he had always felt for his exemplary and affectionate
sister.</p>

<p>One day he was sitting with her in the boudoir, which commanded,
as we have before observed, a view of the approach
to the house, where they saw a horseman coming at full speed.
As he drew near, he seemed to be a middle&ndash;aged man, wearing
a broad&ndash;brimmed hat, a coarse over&ndash;coat, and loose trowsers;
his knees were high up on the saddle, and he rode in
so careless and reckless a manner, that it was marvellous how
the uncouth rider could remain on his horse in a gallop.
Reginald threw open the window; and as the strange&ndash;looking
figure caught a sight of him, the steed was urged yet faster,
and the broad&ndash;brimmed hat was waved in token of recognition.</p>

<p>“Now Heaven be praised!” exclaimed Reginald aloud:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
“’tis Gregson the mate!” He turned towards his sister: the
blood had fled from her cheeks and lip, her hands were clasped
together, and she whispered, in a voice scarcely articulate,
“Heaven be merciful!”</p>

<p>“Nay, Lucy,” said her sanguine brother, “why this grief?
are you not glad that The Pride is returned?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Reginald!” said Lucy, looking on him reproachfully
through the tears which now streamed from her eyes. “Think
you that if <i>he</i> had been alive and well, he would have allowed
another to come here before him! Go and speak to the man—I
cannot see him—you will return and tell me all.”</p>

<p>Reginald felt the reproof, and, kissing her affectionately,
hastened from the room.</p>

<p>Who shall attempt to lift the veil from Lucy’s heart during
the suspense of the succeeding minutes? It is fortunate for
human nature, that at such a moment the mind is too confused
to be conscious of its own sufferings: the mingled emotions of
hope and fear, the half&ndash;breathed prayer, the irresistible desire
to learn, contending with the dread of more assured misery,—all
these unite in producing that agony of suspense which it is
impossible to describe in words, and of which the mind of the
sufferer can scarcely realise afterwards a distinct impression.</p>

<p>After a short absence, Reginald returned, and said to his
sister, “Lucy, Ethelston is not here, but he is alive and safe.”</p>

<p>She hid her face in her brother’s breast, and found relief in
a flood of grateful tears. As soon as Lucy had recovered her
composure, her brother informed her of Ethelston’s captivity,
and of the serious, though not dangerous, wounds that he had
received; but he mingled with the narration such warm
praises of his friend’s heroic defence of the brig, and so many
sanguine assurances of his speedy release and return, that her
fears and her anxiety were for a time absorbed in the glow of
pride with which she listened to the praises of her lover’s conduct,
and in the anticipation of soon having his adventures
from his own lips. The faithful mate received a kind welcome
from the Colonel, and though the latter had sustained a
severe loss in the brig, he viewed it as a misfortune for which
no one could be blamed; and directed all his anxiety and his
inquiries to the condition of Ethelston, whom he loved as his
own son.</p>

<p>“Depend on’t, Colonel,” said Gregson, “he’ll come to no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
harm where is he; for L’Estrange is a fine old fellow, and
Master Ethelston saved his son’s neck from my cutlass. I was
cuttin’ at him in downright airnest, for my dander was up;
and you know, Colonel, a man a’nt particular nice in a deck
scurry like that!”</p>

<p>“And what made him so anxious to save the youngster?”
inquired the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Why I s’pose he thought the day was our own, and the
lieutenant too smart a lad to be roughly handled for naught;
but the young mad&ndash;cap put a pistol&ndash;ball into his arm by way of
thanks.”</p>

<p>“Well, and did Ethelston still protect him?”</p>

<p>“Ay, sir, all the same. I’ve served with a number of captains
o’ one sort or other, smugglers, and slave cruisers, and
old Burt, that the Cuba pirates used to call Gunpowder Jack,
but I will say I never saw a better man than Ethelston step
a deck, whether it’s ‘up stick and make sail,’ or a heavy gale
on a lee&ndash;shore, or a game at long bowls, or a hammer&ndash;away
fight at yard&ndash;arm to yard&ndash;arm, it’s all one to our skipper, he’s
just as cool, and seems as well pleased, as when it’s a free
breeze, a clear sea, and Black Cupid has piped to dinner.”</p>

<p>“He is a gallant young fellow,” said the Colonel, brushing
a little moisture from the corner of his eye; “and we will
immediately take all possible measures for his liberation, both
by applying, through Congress, for his exchange, and by communicating
with the French agents at New Orleans.”</p>

<p>The conversation was protracted for some time; and after
its termination, the mate having satisfied himself that the
Mooshanne cider had lost none of its flavour, and that Monsieur
Perrot’s flask contained genuine cognac, returned in high
spirits to Marietta.</p>

<p>The preparations for Reginald’s expedition now went briskly
forward, as the business which the Colonel wished him to
transact with the trading companies on the Mississippi did not
admit of delay. A large canoe was fitted out at Marietta,
capable of containing sixteen or eighteen persons, and possessing
sufficient stowage for the provisions and goods required:
the charge of it was given to an experienced voyageur, who
had more than once accompanied Baptiste in his excursions to
the Upper Mississippi and the Great Lakes; he was a steady
determined man, on whose fidelity reliance might be placed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and well calculated, from the firmness of his character, to keep
in order the rough and sturdy fellows who formed his crew.
Born and bred in that wild border region which now forms
the State of Michigan, the woods, rapids, and lakes had been
familiar to him from his childhood; unlike most of his tribe,
he was singularly grave and taciturn; he always wore a bearskin
cap, and, whether in his bateau, his canoe, or his log&ndash;hut,
his bed was of the same material, so that he was known only
by the name of “Bearskin;” his paternal appellation, whatever
it might have been originally, having become altogether obsolete
and unknown. His crew consisted of four stout fellows,
who, like most of the Indian borderers, were as skilful in the
use of the paddle on the river as in that of the rifle on the
land. Among them was the gigantic form of Mike Smith,
before mentioned in this narrative; all these were engaged by
the Colonel, at a liberal salary, for six months, which was to
be proportionately increased if they were detained in his service
for a longer period. It was also settled that Monsieur
Gustave Perrot should take his passage in the canoe; and to
his care were entrusted the Indian presents, clothes, and other
articles, which were his master’s own property. Reginald had
resolved to cross the territory on horseback, accompanied by
Baptiste, and he therefore meant to carry with him only such
arms, and other articles, as were likely to be required on the
journey.</p>

<p>The orders given to Bearskin were, to make the best of his
way to St. Louis, and having delivered the letters with which
he was entrusted, there to await Reginald’s arrival. The
cargo of the canoe consisted chiefly (with the exception of a
full supply of arms and provisions) of powder, cutlery, clothes
of various colours, paints, mirrors, and a great variety of beads.
Her equipment was soon completed, and she left Marietta amid
the cheers of the crowd assembled on the wooden pier in front
of David Muir’s store, the latter observing to our old friend the
mate, who stood at his elbow, “I’m thinking, Maister Gregson,
they chaps will hae eneugh o’ the red&ndash;skin deevils, an’
fur&ndash;huntin’ amongst a wheen wild trappers and daft neer&ndash;do&ndash;weels
ayont the Mississippi! Weel a weel, ye maun just step
ben and tak’ a stoup o’ cognac to the success o’ Bearskin and
his crew.”</p>

<p>Although there was much in the merchant’s harangue that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was like Greek or Hebrew to the mate, the closing invitation
being adapted as well to his comprehension as to his inclination,
he expressed a brief but cheerful acquiescence, and the
worthy couple entered the house together. As soon as they
were seated in the parlour, Jessie placed on the table some
excellent corn&ndash;cakes and cheese, together with the before&ndash;mentioned
cognac, and busied herself with even more than her
wonted alacrity, to offer these good things to the father of the
youth towards whom she entertained, as we have said, a secret
but very decided partiality. She carried her hospitality so far
as to bring a bottle of old madeira from David’s favourite
corner in the cellar, which she decanted with great dexterity,
and placed before the mate. The jolly tar complimented the
merchant, after his own blunt fashion, both on the excellence
of his liquor, and the attractions of his daughter, saying, in
reference to the latter, “I can tell you, Master Muir, that I
hold Jessie to be as handsome and as handy a lass as any in
the territory. If I were twenty years younger, I should be
very apt to clap on all sail, and try to make a prize of her!”</p>

<p>At this moment his son entered from the store, under the
pretext of speaking to David about the sale of some goods, but
with the object of being for a few minutes near to Jessie. He
had never spoken to her of love, being afraid that his suit
would certainly be rejected by her parents, who, from their
reputed wealth, would doubtless expect to marry their daughter
to one of the principal personages in the commonwealth of
Marietta. As he entered, his eyes encountered those of Jessie,
who was still blushing from the effect of the compliment paid
to her by his father.</p>

<p>“Harry, my boy,” shouted the mate, “you are just come in
time; I have filled a glass of David’s prime 84, and you must
give me a toast! Now, my lad, speak up; heave a&ndash;head!”</p>

<p>“Father, I am ashamed of you!” replied the youth, colouring.
“How can you ask for another toast when Miss Jessie’s
standing at your elbow?”</p>

<p>“The boy’s right,” said the sailor, “and he shall drink it,
too; shan’t he, David?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking ye’ll no need to ask him twice. Jessie,
hand the lad a glass!”</p>

<p>At her father’s bidding she brought another glass from the
cupboard; and in giving it to young Gregson, one or other of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
them was so awkward, that, instead of it, he took her hand in
his; and although he relinquished it immediately, there was a
pressure, unconscious perhaps, but so distinctly perceptible to
Jessie, that she blushed still deeper, and felt almost relieved
by hearing her name called from the store in the loudest key
of her mother’s shrill voice, while it was repeated yet more
loudly by the honest mate, who gave the toast as she left the
room, “Here’s Jessie Muir,—a long life, and a happy one,
to her!”</p>

<p>Henry Gregson drank the madeira, but he scarcely knew
whether it was sweet or sour, for his blood still danced with
the touch of Jessie’s hand; and setting down the glass, he returned
abruptly to the store, whether in the hope of stealing
another look at her, or to enjoy his own reflections on the
last few minutes, the reader may determine for himself.</p>

<p>The mate and the merchant continued their sitting until the
bottle of madeira was empty, and the flask of cognac was considerably
diminished: and although their conversation was
doubtless highly interesting, and worthy of being listened to
with the greatest attention, yet, as it did not bear immediately
upon the events of our narrative, we will leave it unrecorded
amongst the many other valuable treasures of a similar kind
which are suffered day by day to sink into oblivion.</p>

<p>M. Perrot being now fairly under way, and having taken
with him all the articles required by Reginald for his Indian
expedition, our hero resolved no longer to delay his own departure,
being about to encounter a very tedious land journey
before he could reach St. Louis, and being also desirous of
performing it by easy marches, in order that Nekimi might
arrive at the Osage hunting&ndash;camp fresh, and ready for any of
those emergencies in which success might depend upon his
strength and swiftness. Baptiste was now quite in his element;
and an early day being fixed for their departure, he packed
the few clothes and provisions which they were likely to require
on the journey, in two capacious leather bags, which
were to be slung across the rough hardy nag which had accompanied
him on more than one distant expedition, and he
was soon able to announce to Reginald that he was ready to
start at an hour’s notice.</p>

<p>The parting of our hero from his family was somewhat
trying to his firmness; for poor Lucy, whose nerves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
much affected by her own sorrows, could not control her grief.
Aunt Mary also shed tears, whilst, mingled with her repeated
blessings, and excellent counsel, she gave him several infallible
recipes for the cure of cuts, bruises, and the bite of rattlesnakes.
The Colonel squeezed his hand with concealed emotion,
and bid him remember those whom he left behind, and
not incur any foolish risk in the pursuit of amusement, or in
the excitement of Indian adventure. But it was in parting
with his mother that his feelings underwent the severest trial,
for her health had long been gradually declining; and although
she evinced the resigned composure which marked her gentle
uncomplaining character, there was a deep solemnity in her
farewell benediction, arising from a presentiment that they
might not meet again on this side of the grave. It required
all the beauty of the scenery through which he passed, and all
the constitutional buoyancy of his spirits, to enable Reginald
to shake off the sadness which crept over him, when he caught
from a rising ground the last glimpse of Mooshanne; but the
fresh elasticity of youth ere long prevailed, and he ran his
fingers through the glossy mane that hung over Nekimi’s
arching crest, anticipating with pleasure the wild adventures
by flood and field that they would share together.</p>

<p>Reginald wore the deer&ndash;skin hunting&ndash;suit that we have before
described: his rifle he had sent with the canoe, the bugle
was slung across his shoulders, a brace of horse&ndash;pistols were
in the holsters, and a hunting&ndash;knife hanging at his girdle
completed his equipment. The sturdy guide was more heavily
armed; for besides his long rifle, which he never quitted, a
knife hung on one side of his belt, and at the other was slung
the huge axe which had procured him the name by which
he was known among some of the tribes; but in spite of these
accoutrements, and of the saddle&ndash;bags before mentioned, his
hardy nag paced along with an enduring vigour that would
hardly have been expected from one of so coarse and unpromising
an exterior; sometimes their way lay through the
vast prairies which were still found in the states of Indiana and
Illinois; at others among dense woods and rich valleys, through
which flowed the various tributaries that swell Ohio’s mighty
stream, the guide losing no opportunity of explaining to Reginald
as they went all the signs and secret indications of
Indian or border wood&ndash;craft that occurred. They met with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
abundance of deer, and at night they made their fire; and,
having finished their venison supper, camped under the shelter
of some ancient oak or sycamore. Thus Reginald’s hardy
frame became on this preliminary journey more inured to the
exposure that he would have to undergo among the Osages
and Delawares of the Far&ndash;west: they fell in now and then
with straggling bands of hunters and of friendly Indians, but
with no adventures worthy of record; and thus, after a steady
march of twenty days, they reached the banks of the Mississippi,
and crossed in the ferry to St. Louis.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ESCAPE OF ETHELSTON FROM GUADALOUPE, AND THE CONSEQUENCES
WHICH ENSUED FROM THAT EXPEDITION.</p>

<p class="pn">We left Ethelston on the deck of the little schooner, which
was bearing him rapidly from the shores of Guadaloupe, under
the influence of an easterly wind, so strong that all his attention
was absorbed in the management of the vessel. During
the night the gale increased, and blew with unabated violence
for forty&ndash;eight hours. The Seagull, for so she was called,
scudded lightly before it; and on the third day, Ethelston
had made by his log upwards of five hundred miles of westerly
course.</p>

<p>Having only two hands on board, and the weather being so
uncommonly boisterous, he had been kept in constant employment,
and had only been able to snatch a few brief intervals
for sleep and refreshment: he found Jacques the coxswain an
active able seaman, but extremely silent and reserved, obeying
exactly the orders he received, but scarcely uttering a word,
even to Cupid; it was he alone who attended upon the invalid
and the nurse in the after&ndash;cabin; and the weather having
now moderated, Ethelston asked how the youth had borne the
pitching and tossing of the vessel during the late gale. Jacques
replied, that he was not worse, and seemed not to suffer from
the sea. The captain was satisfied, and retired to his cabin;
he had not been there long before Cupid entered; and carefully
shutting the door behind him, stood before his master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
with a peculiar expression of countenance, which the latter
well knew to intimate some unexpected intelligence.</p>

<p>“Well, Cupid, what is it?” said Ethelston, “is there a
suspicious sail in sight?”</p>

<p>“Very suspicious, Massa Ethelston,” replied the black,
grinning and lowering his voice to a whisper, “and suspicious
goods aboard the schooner.”</p>

<p>“What mean you, Cupid?”</p>

<p>“There is some trick aboard. I not like that Jacques that
never speak, and I not like that sick boy and his nurse, that
nobody never see.”</p>

<p>“But why should you be angry, Cupid, with the poor boy
because he is sick? I have promised to deliver him safe to
his friends at New Orleans, and I hope soon, with this breeze,
to perform my promise.”</p>

<p>“Massa Ethelston, I believe it all one damn trick—I not
believe there is one sick boy: when Jacques come in and go
out of that cabin he creep, and look, and listen, and watch
like the Colonel’s grey cat at the cheese cupboard. Cupid no
pretend to much learnin’, but he no be made fool of by damn
French nigger, and he no tell Massa Ethelston a lie.” So
saying, the African withdrew as quietly as he had entered.</p>

<p>After musing some time on his follower’s communication
and suspicions, he resolved to unravel whatever mystery might
be attached to the matter, by visiting the invalid immediately.
On his knocking gently at the door for admission, he was answered
from within by the nurse that her patient was asleep,
and ought not now to be disturbed; but being determined not
to allow another day to pass in uncertainty, he went on deck,
and summoning Jacques, told him to go down presently and
inform the nurse that in the evening, as soon as her patient was
awake, he should pay him a visit.</p>

<p>Jacques received this mandate with some confusion, and
began to stammer something about the “poor boy not being
disturbed.”</p>

<p>“Harkee, sir,” said Ethelston sternly; “I am captain on
board this craft, and will be obeyed: as you go into that
cabin three or four times a day to attend upon the invalid,
methinks my presence cannot be so dangerous. I will take
the risk upon myself: you hear my orders, sir, and they are
not to be trifled with!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Jacques disappeared, and Ethelston remained pacing the
deck. In about half an hour the latter came up to him and
said, “The young gentleman will receive the captain at sundown.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Ethelston, and continued to pace the
deck, revolving in his mind all the strange events of the last
month,—his illness, the unfortunate passion of Nina, and her
strange behaviour when he bid her farewell.</p>

<p>At the appointed time he went down, and again knocked at
the side cabin door for admission: it was opened by the
nurse, apparently a young woman of colour, who whispered to
him in French, “Go in, sir, and speak gently to him, for he
is very delicate.” So saying, she left the cabin, and closed the
door behind her.</p>

<p>Ethelston approached the sofa, on which the grey evening
light permitted him to see a slight figure, covered with a
mantle; and addressing the invalid kindly, he said, “I fear,
young sir, you must have suffered much during the gale.”</p>

<p>“No, I thank you,” was the reply, but so faintly uttered
as to be scarcely audible.</p>

<p>“Can I do anything to make your stay on board more
comfortable?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the whispered answer.</p>

<p>“Then tell me what, or how; as I have promised to do all
in my power to make the voyage agreeable to you.”</p>

<p>After a pause of a minute, during which the invalid seemed
struggling with repressed emotion, the mantle was suddenly
thrown aside, the recumbent figure sprang from the sofa, and
Nina stood before him! “Yes,” she said; “you <i>have</i> promised—and
my ears drank in the promise: for it, and for
you, I have abandoned home, country, kindred,—what do I
say,—I have abandoned nothing; for you are to me home,
kindred, country, every thing! Dear, dear Ethelston! this
moment repays me for all I have suffered.” As she spoke
thus, she threw her arms round his neck, and hid her blushing
face upon his breast.</p>

<p>Ethelston was so completely taken by surprise, that for a
moment he could not utter a syllable. Mistaking his silence
for a full participation in her own impassioned feelings, and
looking up in her face, her eyes beaming with undisguised
affection, and her dark tresses falling carelessly over her beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
neck, she continued, “Oh, speak—speak one gentle
word,—nay, rather break not this delicious silence, and let
me dream here for ever.”</p>

<p>If Ethelston was for a moment stupified, partly by surprise,
and partly by the effect of her surpassing loveliness, it was
<i>but</i> for a moment. His virtue, pride, and honour were aroused,
and the suggestions of passion found no entrance to his heart.
Firmly, but quietly replacing her on the sofa she had quitted,
he said, in a voice more stern than he had ever before used
when addressing her. “Nina, you have grieved me more than
I can express; you have persisted in seeking a heart which I
frankly told you was not mine to give. I see no longer in you
the Nina whom I first knew in Guadaloupe,—gentle, affectionate,
and docile,—but a wild, headstrong girl, pursuing a
wayward fancy, regardless of truth, and of that maidenly
reserve which is woman’s sweetest charm. Not only have
you thus hurt my feelings, but you have brought a stain upon
my honour,—nay, interrupt me not,” he added, seeing that
she was about to speak; “for I must tell you the truth, and
you must learn to bear it, even though it may sound harsh to
your ears. I repeat, you have brought a stain upon my
honour,—for what will your respected father think of the
man whom he received wounded, suffering, and a prisoner—whom
he cherished with hospitable kindness, and who now
requites all his benefits by stealing from his roof the daughter
of his love, the ornament and blessing of his home? Nina,
I did not think that you would have brought this disgrace and
humiliation upon my name! I have now a sacred and a painful
duty before me, and I will see you no more until I have
restored you to the arms of an offended father. I hope he
will forgive you, as I do, for the wrong that you have done to
both of us. Farewell, Nina.” With these words, spoken in
a voice trembling with contending emotions, he turned and
left the cabin.</p>

<p>Reader! have you ever dwelt in Sicily, or in any other
southern island of volcanic formation? If so, you may have
seen a verdant spot near the base of the mountain, where the
flowers and the herbage were smiling in the fresh beauty of
summer,—where the luxuriant vine mingled her tendrils with
the spreading branches of the elm,—where the air was loaded
with fragrance, and the ear was refreshed by the hum of bees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and the murmur of a rippling stream: on a sudden, the
slumbering mountain&ndash;furnace is aroused—the sulphurous crater
pours forth its fiery deluge, and in a moment the spot so
lately teeming with life, fertility, and fragrance is become the
arid, barren abode of desolation. If, reader, you have seen
this fearful change on the face of nature, or if you can place
it vividly before your imagination, then may you conceive
the state of Nina’s mind, when her long&ndash;cherished love was
thus abruptly and finally rejected by the man for whom she
had sacrificed her home, her parents, and her pride! It is
impossible for language to portray an agony such as that by
which all the faculties of her soul and body seemed absorbed
and benumbed. She neither spoke nor wept, nor gave any
outward sign of suffering, but, with bloodless and silent lips,
sat gazing on vacancy.</p>

<p>Fanchette returned, and looked on her young mistress with
fear and dread. She could neither elicit a word in reply, nor
the slightest indication of her repeated entreaties being understood.
Nina suffered her hands to be chafed, her temples to
be bathed, and at length broke into a loud hysteric laugh,
that rang through the adjoining cabin, and sent a thrill to the
heart of Ethelston. Springing on deck, he ordered Jacques to
go below, and aid Fanchette in attending on her young lady;
and then, with folded arms, he leaned over the low bulwark,
and sat meditating in deep silence on the events of the day.</p>

<p>The moon had risen, and her beams silvered the waves
through which the schooner was cutting her way; scarcely a
fleeting cloud obscured the brightness of the sky, and all nature
seemed hushed in the calm and peaceful repose of night. How
different from the fearful storm now raging in the bosom of
the young girl from whom he was divided only by a few
inches of plank! He shuddered when that thought arose, but
his conscience told him that he was acting aright, and, indulging
in the reverie that possessed him, he saw a distant
figure in the glimmering moonlight, which, as it drew near,
grew more and more distinct, till it wore the form, the features,
and the approving smile of his Lucy! Confirmed and
strengthened in his resolutions, he started from his seat, and
bid the astonished Cupid, who was now at the helm, to prepare
to go about, and stand to the eastward. Jacques was
called from below, the order was repeated in a sterner voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the sails were trimmed, and in a few minutes the schooner
was close&ndash;hauled and laying her course, as near as the wind
would permit, for Guadaloupe.</p>

<p>While these events were passing on board The Seagull,
Captain L’Estrange had returned in the frigate to Point à
Pitre. His grief and anger may be better imagined than
described, when he learnt the flight of his daughter and of
his prisoner, together with the loss of his yacht and two of
his slaves.</p>

<p>Concluding that the fugitives would make for New Orleans,
he dispatched The Hirondelle immediately in pursuit, with
orders to discover them if possible, and to bring them back by
stratagem or force. He also wrote to Colonel Brandon, painting
in the blackest colours the treachery and ingratitude of
Ethelston, and calling upon him, as a man of honour, to disown
and punish the perpetrator of such an outrage on the
laws of hospitality.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the latter was straining every nerve to reach
again the island from which he had so lately escaped. In this
object he was hindered, not only by baffling winds, but by the
obstinacy of Jacques, who, justly fearing the wrath of his
late master, practised every man&oelig;uvre to frustrate Ethelston’s
design. But the latter was on his guard; and unless he was
himself on deck, never trusted the helm in the coxswain’s
hands.</p>

<p>He learnt from Fanchette that Nina was in a high fever,
and quite delirious; but though he inquired constantly after
her, and ordered every attention to be paid to her that was
within his power, he adhered firmly to the resolution that he
had formed of never entering her cabin.</p>

<p>After a few days’ sailing to the eastward, when Ethelston
calculated that he should not now be at a great distance from
Guadaloupe, he fell in with a vessel which proved to be The
Hirondelle. The Seagull was immediately recognised; and
the weather being fair, the lieutenant, and eight men, came on
board. The French officer was no sooner on the deck than he
ordered his men to seize and secure Ethelston, and to place the
two blacks in irons.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Ethelston indignantly remonstrated
against such harsh and undeserved treatment. The officer would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
listen to no explanation; and without deigning a reply, ordered
his men to carry their prisoners on board The Hirondelle.</p>

<p>On reaching Point à Pitre, they were all placed in separate
places of confinement; and Nina was, not without
much risk and difficulty, conveyed to her former apartment in
her father’s house. The delirium of fever seemed to have
permanently affected the poor girl’s brain. She sang wild
snatches of songs, and told those about her that her lover was
often with her, but that he was invisible. Sometimes she fancied
herself on board a ship, and asked them which way the wind
blew, and whether they were near the shore. Then she would
ask for a guitar, and tell them that she was a mermaid, and
would sing them songs that the fishes loved to hear.</p>

<p>The distracted father often sat and listened to these incoherent
ravings, until he left the room in an agony not to be
described; and when alone, vented the most fearful imprecations
on the supposed treachery and ingratitude of Ethelston.
He could not bring himself to see the latter; “for,” said he,
“I must kill him, if I set eyes on his hateful person:” but
he one day wrote the following lines, which he desired to be
delivered to his prisoner:—</p>

<p>“A father, whose indignation is yet greater than his agony,
desires to know what plea you can urge in extenuation of the
odious crimes laid to your charge:—the deliberate theft of
his slaves and yacht, and the abduction and ruin of his child,
in recompense for misplaced trust, kindness, and hospitality?”</p>

<p>Poor Ethelston, in the gloomy solitude of the narrow
chamber where he was confined, read and re&ndash;read the above
lines many times before he would trust himself to reply to them.
He felt for the misery of L’Estrange, and he was too proud and
too generous to exculpate himself by the narration of Nina’s
conduct: nay, although he knew that by desiring L’Estrange
to examine separately Fanchette and Jacques, his own innocence,
and the deceit practised upon him, would be brought to
light, he could not bring himself to forget that delicacy which
Nina had herself forgotten; nor add, to clear himself, one
mite to the heavy weight of visitation that had already fallen
upon her. He contented himself with sending the following
answer:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbqh p1">“Sir,</p>

<p class="pbq">“Your words, though harsh, would be more than merited
by the crimes of which you believe me guilty. There is a
Being above, who reads the heart, and will judge the conduct
of us all. If I am guilty of the crimes imputed to me, His
vengeance will inflict on me, through the stings of conscience,
punishment more terrible even than the wrath of a justly
offended father could desire for the destroyer of his child. If I
am not guilty, He, in His own good time, will make it known,
and will add to your other heavy sorrows regret for having
unjustly charged with such base ingratitude</p>

<p class="pbqr6">“Your servant and prisoner,</p>
<p class="pbqr">“<span class="smcap">E. Ethelston</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">On receiving the above letter, which seemed dictated by a
calm consciousness of rectitude, L’Estrange’s belief of his prisoner’s
guilt was for a moment staggered; and had he bethought
himself of cross&ndash;examining the other partners in the escape, he
would doubtless have arrived at the truth; but his feelings
were too violently excited to permit the exercise of his reason;
and tearing the note to pieces, he stamped upon it, exclaiming
in a paroxysm of rage, “Dissembling hypocrite! does he
think to cozen me with words, as he has poisoned poor Nina’s
peace?”</p>

<p>Her disorder now assumed a different character. The excitement
of delirium ceased, and was succeeded by a feebleness
and gradual wasting, which baffled all the resources of medicine;
and such was the apathy and stupor that clouded her
faculties, that even her father could scarcely tell whether she
knew him or not. In this state she continued for several
days; and the physician at length informed L’Estrange that
he must prepare himself for the worst, and that all hope of
recovery was gone.</p>

<p>Madame L’Estrange had, under the pressure of anxiety,
forgotten her habitual listlessness, and watched by her daughter’s
couch with a mother’s unwearied solicitude. On the night
succeeding the above sad announcement, Nina sunk into a
quiet sleep, which gave some hope to her sanguine parents,
and induced them also to permit themselves a few hours’
repose.</p>

<p>In the morning she awoke: her eye no longer dwelt on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
vacancy: a slight flush was visible on her transparent cheek,
and she called her father, in a voice feeble indeed, but clear
and distinct. Who shall paint the rapture with which he
hailed the returning dawn of reason and of hope? But his
joy was of brief duration; for Nina, beckoning him to approach
yet nearer, said “God be thanked that I may yet beg
your blessing and forgiveness, dearest father!” then pressing
her wasted hand upon her brow, she continued, after a short
pause, “Yes, I remember it all now—all; the orange&ndash;grove—the
flight—the ship—the last meeting! Oh; tell me,
where is he?—where is Ethelston?”</p>

<p>“He is safe confined,” answered L’Estrange, scarcely repressing
his rage; “he shall not escape punishment. The
villain shall yet know the weight of an injured father’s—“
Ere he could conclude the sentence, Nina, by a sudden exertion,
half rose in her bed, and grasping his arm convulsively,
said, “Father, curse him not—you know not what you say;
it is on me, on me alone, that all your anger should fall: listen,
and speak not, for my hours are numbered, and my strength
nearly spent.” She then proceeded to tell him in a faint but
distinct voice, all the particulars already known to the reader,
keeping back nothing in her own defence, and confessing how
Ethelston had been deceived, and how she had madly persisted
in her endeavours to win his love, after he had explicitly owned
to her that his heart and hand were promised to another.</p>

<p>“I solemnly assure you,” she said in conclusion, “that he
never spoke to me of love, that he warned me as a brother,
and reproved me as a father; but I would not be counselled.
His image filled my thoughts, my senses, my whole soul—it
fills them yet; and if you wish your poor Nina to die in
peace, let her see you embrace him as a friend and son.” So
saying she sunk exhausted on her pillow.</p>

<p>L’Estrange could scarcely master the agitation excited by
this narration. After a short pause he replied, “My poor
child! I fear you dream again. I wrote only a few days ago
to Ethelston, charging him with his villany, and asking what
he could say in his defence? His reply was nothing but a
canting subterfuge.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” inquired Nina, faintly.</p>

<p>L’Estrange repeated the words of the note. As he did so
a sweet smile stole over her countenance; and clasping her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hands together, she exclaimed, “Like himself—noble, generous
Ethelston! Father, you are blind; he would not exculpate
himself by proclaiming your daughter’s shame! If you
doubt me, question Fanchette—Jacques—who know it all
too well; but you will not doubt me, dear—dear father!
By that Being to whose presence I am fast hastening, I tell
you only the truth; by His name I conjure you to comfort
my last moments, by granting my last request!”</p>

<p>L’Estrange averted his face: and rising almost immediately,
desired an attendant to summon Ethelston without
delay.</p>

<p>A long pause ensued: Nina’s lips moved as if in silent
prayer; and her father, covering his face with his hands, struggled
to control the anguish by which his firmness was all but
overpowered. At length Ethelston entered the room; he had
been informed that Nina was very ill, but was by no means
aware of the extremity of her danger. Naturally indignant
at the treatment he had lately received, knowing it to be undeserved,
and ignorant of the purpose for which he was now
called, his manner was cold, and somewhat haughty, as he inquired
the commands which Captain L’Estrange might have
for his prisoner.</p>

<p>The agonised father sought in vain for utterance: his only
reply was to point to the almost lifeless form of his child.</p>

<p>One glance from the bed to the countenance of L’Estrange
was sufficient to explain all to Ethelston, who sprang forward,
and, wringing the old captain’s hand, faltered in a voice of
deep emotion, “Oh! forgive me for so speaking,—I knew
nothing—nothing of this dreadful scene!” then turning from
him, he fixed his eyes upon Nina, while the convulsive working
of his features showed that his habitual self&ndash;command was
scarcely equal to support the present unexpected trial.</p>

<p>The deadly paleness of her brow contrasted with the disordered
tresses of her dark hair, the long eyelashes, reposing
upon the transparent cheek, which wore a momentary hectic
glow, the colourless lip, and the thin wan fingers, crossed
meekly upon her breast,—all gave to her form and features
an air of such unearthly beauty, that Ethelston almost doubted
whether the spirit still lingered in its lovely mansion: but his
doubts were soon resolved; for having finished the unuttered
but fervent prayer which she had been addressing to the Throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of Grace, she again unclosed her eyes; and when they rested
upon his countenance, a sweet smile played round her lip, and
a warmer flush came over her cheek. Extending her hand to
him, she said, “Can you forgive me for all the wrong I have
done you?”</p>

<p>In reply, he pressed her fingers to his lips, for he could not
speak. She continued: “I know that I grievously wronged
my parents; but the wrong which I did to you was yet more
cruel. God be thanked for giving me this brief but precious
hour for atonement. You more than once called me your
sister and your friend!—be a brother to me now. And
you, dearest father, if your love outweighs my fault,—if you
wish your child to die happy, embrace him for my sake,
and repair the injustice that you have done to his generous
nature!”</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other; their hearts were melted,
and their cordial embrace brought a ray of gladness to Nina’s
eyes. “God be thanked!” she murmured faintly. “Let my
mother now come, that I may receive her blessing too.”</p>

<p>While L’Estrange went to summon his wife to a scene
which the weakness of her mind and nerves rendered her unequal
to support, Nina continued: “Dear, dear Ethelston, let me
hear your voice; the madness, the passion, the jealousy, that
filled my bosom are all past; but the love is there, imperishable:
tell me, my friend, counsellor, brother, that you are not
angry with me for saying so now.”</p>

<p>Again the wasted fingers were pressed to his burning lip;
his tongue could not yet find utterance, but a tear which fell
upon them told to the sufferer that there was no indifference
in that silence.</p>

<p>Captain L’Estrange now entered, accompanied by his wife.
Although a weak and foolish woman, her heart was not dead
to those natural affections of a mother which the present scene
might be expected to call forth; she wept long and violently
over her dying child, and perhaps her grief might be embittered
by a whisper of conscience that her sufferings were more
or less attributable to neglected education. Fearing that her
mother’s excessive agitation might exhaust Nina’s scanty store
of remaining strength, Ethelston suggested to Captain L’Estrange
to withdraw her into the adjoining apartment; and approaching
the sufferer, he whispered a few words in her ear. A sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
smile played upon her countenance as she answered, “Yes,
and without delay.”</p>

<p>Following her retiring parents from the room, he motioned
to the priest, who was waiting at the door, to enter; and the
sad party remained together while the confessor performed the
rites of his sacred office. Madame L’Estrange was so overpowered
by her grief, that she was removed, almost insensible,
to her own apartment; while, upon a signal from the holy man,
Ethelston and the father re&ndash;entered that of Nina.</p>

<p>Addressing the latter, she said, in a faint voice, “Dearest
father, I have made my peace with Heaven; let me add one
more prayer to you for peace and forgiveness on earth!”</p>

<p>“Speak it, my child; it is already granted,” said the softened
veteran.</p>

<p>“Pardon, for my sake, Fanchette and Jacques: they have
committed a great offence; but it was I who urged them to it.”</p>

<p>“It is forgiven; and they shall not be punished,” replied
L’Estrange: while Ethelston, deeply touched by this amiable
remembrance of the offending slaves at such a moment, whispered
to her in a low voice—</p>

<p>“‘Blessed are the peace&ndash;makers; for they shall be called the
children of God!’”</p>

<p>A grateful pressure of the hand which he had placed in hers
was the only reply, as she continued, addressing L’Estrange,
“And let them marry, father; I know they love each other;
and those who love should marry.” Here her voice became
feebler and feebler, as, once more opening her dark eyes, which
shone with preternatural lustre upon Ethelston, she added,
“You, too, will marry; but none will ever love you like your ...
sister!—closer—closer yet! let me feel your breath.
Father, join your hand to his—so! This death is—Par——“</p>

<p>The closing word died upon her lips; but the angelic smile
that lingered there seemed to emanate from that Paradise
which their last moments strove in vain to name. Her earthly
sorrows were at rest, and the bereaved father fell exhausted
into Ethelston’s arms.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">EXCURSION ON THE PRAIRIE.—THE PARTY FALL IN WITH A VETERAN
HUNTER.</p>

<p class="pn">We must now return to Reginald and his trusty follower;
Baptiste, whom we left at St. Louis, where they were busily
employed in disposing of Colonel Brandon’s share of the peltries
brought in by the trapping party, which he had partly
furnished the preceding year. They did not find much difficulty
in effecting an advantageous sale to two of the other partners
in the expedition,—active, enterprising men, who, from
their connection with the Mackinaw Fur Company, were sure
of reselling at considerable profit.</p>

<p>As soon as these affairs were settled, Reginald, who had
been joined by Perrot, Bearskin, and the remaining crew of
the canoe, resolved to defer no longer his proposed journey
into the Osage country. He left all the arrangements to Baptiste
and Bearskin, under whose superintendence the preparations
advanced so rapidly, that at the end of a week they were
satisfactorily completed.</p>

<p>It had been determined to leave the canoe at St. Louis, and
to perform the journey by land; for this purpose a strong
saddle&ndash;horse was purchased for each of the party, together with
six pack&ndash;horses, and as many mules, for the transfer of the ammunition,
baggage, and presents for their Indian allies. Four
additional Canadian “coureurs des bois” were engaged to
take charge of the packs; so that, when they started for the
Western Prairies, the party mustered twelve in number, whose
rank and designation were as follow:—</p>

<p>Reginald Brandon; Baptiste, his lieutenant; Bearskin, who,
in the absence of the two former, was to take the command;
M. Perrot, Mike Smith, with three other border&ndash;hunters, and
the four Canadians, completed the party.</p>

<p>Baptiste had taken care to place among the packages an
abundance of mirrors, cutlery, and other articles most highly
prized by the savages. He had also selected the horses with
the greatest care, and two spare ones were taken, in case of accidents
by the way. When all was ready, even the taciturn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Bearskin admitted that he had never seen a party so well fitted
out, in every respect, for an Indian expedition.</p>

<p>It was a lovely morning when they left St. Louis, and entered
upon the broad track which led through the deep Missourian
forest, with occasional openings of prairie towards a
trading&ndash;post lately opened on the Osage, a river which runs
from S. W. to N. E. and falls into the Missouri. Of all the
party, none were in such exuberant spirits as Perrot, who,
mounted on an active, spirited, little Mestang horse<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, capering
beside the bulky figure of Mike Smith, addressed to him various
pleasantries in broken English, which the other, if he understood
them, did not deign to notice.</p>

<p>It was now near the close of May, and both the prairie and
the woodland scenery were clad in the beautiful and varied
colours of early summer; the grassy road along which they
wound their easy way was soft and elastic to the horses’ hoofs;
and as they travelled farther from the settlements scattered
near St. Louis, the frequent tracks of deer which they observed
tempted Reginald to halt his party, and encamp for the night,
while he and Baptiste sallied forth to provide for them a venison
supper.</p>

<p>After a short hunting ramble they returned, bearing with
them the saddle of a fine buck. A huge fire was lighted; the
camp&ndash;kettles and other cooking utensils were in immediate request,
and the travellers sat down to enjoy their first supper in
the Missourian wilderness.</p>

<p>Monsieur Perrot was now quite in his element, and became
at once an universal favourite, for never had any of the party
tasted coffee or flour&ndash;cakes so good, or venison steaks of so delicate
a flavour. His good&ndash;humour was as inexhaustible as his
inventive culinary talent; and they were almost disposed to
believe in his boasting assurance, that so long as there was a
buffalo&ndash;hide or an old mocassin left among them, they should
never want a good meal.</p>

<p>Having supped and smoked a comfortable pipe, they proceeded
to bivouac for the night. By the advice of Baptiste,
Reginald had determined to accustom his party, from the first,
to those precautionary habits which might soon become so
essential to their safety; a regular rotation of sentry duty was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
established, the horses were carefully secured, and every man
lay down with his knife in his belt, and his loaded rifle at his
side: the packs were all carefully piled, so as to form a low
breastwork, from behind which they might fire in case of sudden
attack; and when these dispositions were completed, those
who were not on the watch wrapped themselves in their blankets
or buffalo skins, and, with their feet towards the fire, slept
as comfortably as on a bed of down.</p>

<p>For two days they continued their march in a north&ndash;west
direction, meeting with no incident worthy of record; the
hunters found abundance of game of every description, and
Monsieur Perrot’s skill was daily exercised upon prairie&ndash;hens,
turkeys, and deer. On the third day, as they were wending
their way leisurely down a wooded valley, the sharp crack of a
rifle was heard at no great distance. Reginald, desiring to ascertain
whether Indians or White men were hunting in the
neighbourhood, halted his party, and went forward, accompanied
by Baptiste, to endeavour, unperceived, to approach the
person whose shot they had heard. A smooth grassy glade
facilitated their project, and a slight column of smoke curling
up from an adjoining thicket served to guide them towards the
spot. Ere they had advanced far, the parting of the brushwood
showed them that the object of their search was approaching
the place where they stood, and they had barely
time to conceal themselves in a bush of sumach, when the
unknown hunter emerged from the thicket, dragging after him
a fine deer. He was a powerful man of middling height, not
very unlike Baptiste in dress and appearance, but even more
embrowned and weather&ndash;beaten than the trusty guide; he
seemed to be about fifty years of age, and the hair on his temples
was scant and grey; his countenance was strikingly expressive
of boldness and resolution, and his eye seemed as clear
and bright as that of a man in the early prime of life. Leaning
his rifle against an adjoining tree, he proceeded to handle
and feel his quarry, to ascertain the proportions of fat and
meat; the examination seemed not unsatisfactory, for when it
was concluded he wiped the perspiration from his brow, and
with a complacent smile muttered half aloud, “Ah, ‘t ain’t
every day as a man can find a saddle like that in old Kentuck
now—what with their dogs, and girdlins, and clearins, and
hog&ndash;feedings, and the other devilments of the settlements, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
deer’s all driven out of the country, or if it ain’t driven out,
they run all the fat off, so that it’s only fit to feed one of your
tradin’ town&ndash;bred fellows, who wouldn’t know a prime buck
from a Lancaster sheep!”</p>

<p>After this brief soliloquy, the veteran sportsman tucked up
the sleeve of his hunting&ndash;shirt, and proceeded to skin and cut
up his quarry, with a skill and despatch that showed him to be
a perfect master of his craft. Reginald and Baptiste had
remained silent observers of his proceedings, but the former
inferred from the pleased twinkle of the guide’s grey eyes, and
the comic working of the muscles of his mouth, that the solitary
hunter was no stranger to him: touching Baptiste lightly,
he whispered, “I see that we have come across an acquaintance
of yours in this remote place.”</p>

<p>“That we have Master Reginald,” said the guide; “and
you’d have known him too, if you’d spent some of the years
in Kentuck as you passed at those colleges in the old country;
but we’ll just step out and hail him, for though he ain’t particular
fond of company, he’s not the man to turn his back
on a friend to whom he has once given his hand.”</p>

<p>So saying he rose from his hiding&ndash;place, and coming out on
the open glade, before Reginald could inquire the stranger’s
name, the guide said aloud, “A prime buck, colonel; I see
your hand’s as steady as ever!”</p>

<p>At the first sound of a voice addressing him in his own
language, a shade of displeasure came across the hunter’s
countenance; but as he recognised the speaker it disappeared
instantly, and he replied, “Ha! Baptiste, my old friend, is
that you? What chase are you on here?”</p>

<p>So saying, he grasped the horney hand of the guide with a
heartiness which proved that the latter was really welcome.</p>

<p>“Why, colonel, I’m out on a kind o’ mixed hunt this turn
with this young gentleman, whose father, Colonel Brandon,
you’ve known many a day. Master Reginald, I’m sure you’ll
be glad to be acquainted with Colonel Boone, howbeit you
little expected to find him in this part of the airth.”</p>

<p>At the mention of the stranger’s name, Reginald’s hand was
raised unconsciously to his cap, which he doffed respectfully
as he said, “I am indeed glad to meet the celebrated Daniel
Boone, whose name is as familiar to every western hunter as
that of Washington or Franklin in our cities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“My young friend,” said the colonel, laughing good&ndash;humouredly,
“I am heartily glad to see your father’s son, but
you must not bring the ways of the city into the woods, by
flattering a rough old bear&ndash;hunter with fine words.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Reginald, “there is no flattery, for Baptiste
here has spoken of you to me a hundred times, and has told
me as often, that a better hunter or a better man does not
breathe. You seem to have known him some time, and must
therefore be able to judge whether he is of a flattering sort or
not.”</p>

<p>“Why, it wasn’t much his trade, I allow,” replied the
colonel, “in old times, when he and I hunted bear for three
weeks together in the big laurel thicket at Kentucky Forks. I
believe, Baptiste, that axe at your belt is the very one with
which you killed the old she, who wasn’t pleased because we
shot down two of her cubs; she hadn’t manners enough to
give us time to load again: and when you split her skull handsomely,
she was playing a mighty unpleasant game with the
stock of my rifle. Ah, that was a reasonable quiet country in
those days,” continued the colonel: “we had no trouble, but
a lively bit of a skrimmage, now and then, with the Indians,
until the Browns, and Frasers, and Micklehams, and heaven
knows how many more, came to settle in it; and what with
their infernal ploughs, and fences, and mills, the huntin’ was
clean spoilt. I stayed as long as I could, for I’d a kind o’
likin’ to it; but at last I couldn’t go ten mile any way without
comin’ to some clearin’ or log&ndash;hut; so says I to myself,
‘colonel, the sooner you clear out o’ this, the better you’ll
be pleased.’”</p>

<p>“Well, colonel,” said the guide, “I heard you had moved
away from the Forks, and had gone further down west, but
they never told me you had crossed the big river.”</p>

<p>“I only came here last fall,” replied the colonel; “for I
found, in Kentucky, that as fast as I moved, the settlers and
squatters followed; so I thought I’d dodge ‘em once for all,
and make for a country where the deer and I could live comfortably
together.”</p>

<p>“As we have thus accidentally fallen in with you,” said
Reginald, “I hope you will take a hunter’s meal with us before
we part; our men and baggage are not a mile from this
spot, and Colonel Boone’s company will be a pleasure to us all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The invitation was accepted as frankly as it was given.</p>

<p>Baptiste shouldered the colonel’s venison, and in a short
time the three rejoined Reginald’s party. Daniel Boone’s
name alone was sufficient in the west to ensure him a hearty
welcome. Perrot’s talents were put into immediate requisition,
and ere long the game and poultry of the prairie were roasting
before a capital fire, while the indefatigable Frenchman prepared
the additional and unusual luxuries of hot maize&ndash;cakes
and coffee.</p>

<p>During the repast, Reginald learnt from Colonel Boone
that various parties of Indians had been lately hunting in the
neighbourhood. He described most of them as friendly, and
willing to trade in meat or skins for powder and lead; he
believed them to belong to the Konsas, a tribe once powerful,
and resident on the river called by that name, falling into the
Missouri, about a hundred miles to the north&ndash;west of the place
where our party were now seated; but the tribe had been
of late reduced by the ravages of the small&ndash;pox, and by the
incursions of the Pawnees, a nation more numerous and warlike,
whose villages were situated a hundred miles higher up
the same river.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The colonel described the neighbourhood as abounding in
elk, deer, bear, and turkeys: but he said that the beaver and
the buffalo were already scarce, the great demand for their
skins having caused them to be hunted quite out of the region
bordering on the settlements. After spending a couple of
hours agreeably with our party, the veteran sportsman shouldered
his trusty rifle, and wishing our hero a successful hunt
and shaking his old comrade Baptiste cordially by the hand,
walked off leisurely in a northerly direction, towards his present
abode; which was not, he said, so far distant but that he
should easily reach it before sundown.</p>

<p>As the last glimpse of his retiring figure was lost in the
shades of the forest, the guide uttered one of those grunts
which he sometimes unconsciously indulged. Reginald knew
that on these occasions there was something on his mind: and
guessing that it referred to their departed guest, he said,—</p>

<p>“Well, Baptiste, I am really glad to have seen Daniel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Boone; and I can truly say I am not disappointed; he seems
to be just the sort of man that I expected to see.”</p>

<p>“He is a sort,” said the guide, “that we don’t see every
day, Master Reginald. Perhaps he ain’t much of a talker;
and he don’t use to quarrel unless there’s a reason for ‘t; but
if he’s once aggravated, or if his friend’s in a scrape, he’s
rather apt to be dangerous.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it not,” said Reginald; “there is a quiet look of
resolution about him; and, in a difficulty, I would rather
have one such man with me than two or three of your violent,
noisy brawlers.”</p>

<p>As he said this his eye inadvertently rested upon the huge
figure of Mike Smith, who was seated at a little distance,
lazily smoking his pipe, and leaning against a log of fallen
timber. The guide observed the direction of Reginald’s eye,
and guessed what was passing in his mind. A grave smile
stole for a moment over his features; but he made no reply,
and in a few minutes, the marching orders being issued, the
party resumed their journey.</p>

<p>On the following day they reached a point where the track
branched off in two directions; the broader, and more beaten,
to the N. W.; the other towards the S. W. The guide informed
them that the former led along by the few scattered
settlements that were already made on the southern side
of the Missouri, towards the ferry and trading&ndash;post near the
mouth of the Konsas river; while the smaller, and less beaten
track, led towards the branch of Osage river, on which the
united party of Delawares and Osages, whom they sought, were
encamped.</p>

<p>Having followed this track for fifty miles, they came to a
spot well known among hunters by the name of the Elk Flats,
where the branch of the Osage, called Grand River, is fordable.
Here they crossed without accident or difficulty, except that
M. Perrot’s horse missed his footing, and slipped into a deeper
part of the stream. The horse swam lustily, and soon reached
the opposite bank; but the Frenchman had cast himself off,
and now grasped with both hands an old limb of a tree that
was imbedded near the middle of the river; he could just touch
the ground with his feet; but, being a bad swimmer, he was
afraid to let go his hold, for fear of being again swept away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
by the current, while his rueful countenance, and his cries for
assistance, provoked the mirth of all the party.</p>

<p>After enjoying his valet’s alarm for a few minutes, Reginald,
who had already crossed, entered the river again with Nekimi,
and approaching Perrot, desired him to grasp the mane firmly
in his hand, and leave the rest to the animal’s sagacity, which
instruction being obeyed, he was safely brought ashore, and
in a short time was laughing louder than the rest at his own
fright, and at the ludicrous predicament from which he had
been extricated.</p>

<p>The packages were all conveyed across without accident,
and the party found themselves encamped in what was then
considered a part of the Osage country. Here they were
obliged to use greater vigilance in the protection of their camp
and of their horses during the night, as they had not yet
smoked the pipe with the chiefs, and were liable to an attack
from a party of warriors or horse&ndash;stealers.</p>

<p>The night passed, however, without any disturbance; and
on the following day at noon they reached a spot which Baptiste
recognised as a former camping&ndash;place of the Osages, and
which he knew to be not distant from their present village.
Here his attention was suddenly drawn to an adjoining maple,
on the bark of which sundry marks were rudely cut, and in a
fork of the tree were three arrows, and as many separate bunches
of horsehair. He examined all these carefully, and replaced
them exactly as he found them; after which he informed
Reginald that three braves of the Osages had gone forward
during the past night on a war&ndash;excursion towards the Konsas,
and all these marks were left to inform their followers of their
purpose, and the exact path which they intended to pursue. He
also advised Reginald to halt his party here, while he went on
himself with one of the men to the village, it being contrary
to the customs of Indian etiquette for a great man to come
among them unannounced.</p>

<p>Reginald adopted his counsel, and the sturdy guide, accompanied
by one of the coureurs des bois, set out upon his mission,
the result of which will appear in the following chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">REGINALD AND HIS PARTY REACH THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT.</p>

<p class="pn">The guide and his companion pursued their way leisurely
along a beaten track, which led them through a well&ndash;timbered
valley, watered by one of the branches of Grand River, until
it emerged upon a rising slope of open prairie. Having
gained its summit, they saw at a little distance the Indian
encampment stretched along the banks of a rivulet, which,
after curving round the base of the hill on which they now
stood, found its way to the line of heavy timber that marked
the course of the main river. They were soon hailed by a
mounted Delaware scout, to whom Baptiste explained the
peaceful nature of his mission, and desired to be shown into
the presence of the principal chiefs.</p>

<p>As the guide walked through the scattered lodges of the
Delawares, his eye rested on more than one Indian to whom
he was well known; but as he was now acting in the capacity
of ambassador, it was not consistent with Indian usage that
he should speak or be spoken to by others on the way. So
well did he know the habits of the people among whom he
now found himself, that when he arrived before the lodge of
the Great Chief, he passed by War&ndash;Eagle and Wingenund,
who had come to its entrance on the approach of a stranger,
and giving them merely a silent sign of recognition, took the
place pointed out to him in the centre of the lodge, by the side
of the venerable man who was the head of this emigrant band
of the Lenapé; to whom, as the highest proof of their respect
and veneration, they had given the name of Tamenund<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, by
which alone he was now known throughout the nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The pipe of welcome having been presented, and been
smoked for a few minutes with becoming gravity, Baptiste
opened to Tamenund the object of his visit, and informed him
that a white warrior and chief, already known to some of the
Delawares present, desired to eat, to smoke, and to hunt with
them for a season as a brother. To this Tamenund, who had
already been informed by War&ndash;Eagle of the character and conduct
of Reginald, as well as of his promised visit, replied with
becoming dignity and hospitality, that the young white chief
should be welcome; that his heart was known to be great
among the Delawares, and that both he and his people should
be held as brothers; at the same time he informed the guide,
that as they were about to move their encampment immediately
to a more favourable spot, it might be better for the white
chief to join them on the following morning, when all should
be prepared for his reception.</p>

<p>The guide having acceded to this suggestion, rose to take
his leave, and retired with his companion from the village.
Before they had gone a mile on their return, they heard behind
them the trampling of horses, and Baptiste recognised War&ndash;Eagle
and Wingenund approaching at full speed, who greeted
him cordially, and made many inquiries about Netis and the
Lily of Mooshanne.</p>

<p>Having acquired the desired information, it was agreed, that
before noon on the following day Reginald should come to the
spot where they were now conversing, and that War&ndash;Eagle
should be there to escort and accompany him to his first meeting
with the Delaware and Osage chiefs.</p>

<p>These preliminaries being arranged, the Indians galloped
back to the village, and Baptiste returned without accident or
interruption to Reginald’s camp, where he gave an account of
his mission and of the arrangements for the morrow’s conference.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning they set forth towards the
Indian village. By Baptiste’s advice, Reginald attired himself
more gaily than usual; his hunting&ndash;shirt and leggins of
elk&ndash;skin were ornamented with fringes; the bugle slung across
his shoulders was suspended by a green cord adorned with
tassels; on his head he wore a forage&ndash;cap, encircled by a gold
band; a brace of silver&ndash;mounted pistols were stuck in his
belt, and a German boar&ndash;knife hung at his side; he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
allowed Baptiste to ornament Nekimi’s bridle with beads after
the Indian fashion; and the noble animal pranced under his
gallant rider, as if conscious that he was expected to show his
beauty and his mettle. The dress and appearance of Reginald,
though fanciful and strange, was rendered striking by the
grace and muscular vigour of his frame, as well as by the
open, fearless character of his countenance; and the party of
white men went gaily forward, confident in the favourable impression
which their young leader would make on their Indian
allies.</p>

<p>When they reached the spot where Baptiste had, on the
preceding day, parted from War&ndash;Eagle, they descried two
Indians sitting at the root of an old maple&ndash;tree, as if awaiting
their arrival: a single glance enabled Reginald to recognise
them, and springing from his horse, he greeted War&ndash;Eagle
and Wingenund with affectionate cordiality, and read in the
looks of both, though they spoke little, that he was heartily
welcome. When they had saluted Baptiste, Reginald introduced
them in form to the other members of his party, and,
among the rest, to Monsieur Perrot, who having as yet seen
few Indians, and those of the meanest class, was surprised at
the noble and dignified appearance of War&ndash;Eagle, to whom he
doffed his cap with as much respect as if he had been a field&ndash;marshal
of France.</p>

<p>Having made a short halt, during which the pipe was passed
round, and some cakes of Indian corn and honey set before
their guests, the party again moved forward, under the guidance
of War&ndash;Eagle. Leaving the heavy timber in the valley,
they ascended the opposite hill, where a magnificent prospect
opened upon their view; below them was an undulating prairie
of boundless extent, through the middle of which ran a tributary
branch of Grand River; behind them lay the verdant mass of
forest from which they had lately emerged; the plain in front
was dotted with the lodges of the Delawares and Osages, while
scattered groups of Indians, and grazing horses, gave life,
animation, and endless variety to the scene.</p>

<p>Halting for a moment on the brow of the hill, War&ndash;Eagle
pointed out to Reginald the lodge of his father Tamenund,
distinguished above the rest by its superior size and elevation,
and at the same time showed him at the other extremity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the encampment, a lodge of similar dimensions, which he described
as being that of the Osage chief.</p>

<p>“How is he called?” inquired Reginald.</p>

<p>“Mahéga,” replied the War&ndash;Eagle.</p>

<p>At the mention of this name, the guide uttered one of those
peculiar sounds, something between a whistle and a grunt, by
which Reginald knew that something was passing in his mind;
but on this occasion, without apparently noticing the interruption,
he continued, addressing War&ndash;Eagle, “Will Mahéga
receive me too as a brother—is the Osage chief a friend to the
white men?”</p>

<p>“Mahéga is a warrior,” replied the Indian; “he hunts
with the Lenapé, and he must be a friend of their brother.”</p>

<p>Not only did this answer appear evasive, but there was
also something more than usually constrained in the tone and
manner of War&ndash;Eagle, which did not escape the observation
of Reginald, and with the straightforward openness of his
character, he said, “War&ndash;Eagle, my heart is open to you, and
my tongue can be silent if required—speak to me freely, and
tell me if Mahéga is a friend or not; is he a brave or a
snake?”</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle, fixing his searching eye upon Reginald’s countenance,
replied, “Mahéga is a warrior—the scalps in his
lodge are many—his name is not a lie, but his heart is not
that of a Lenapé—War&ndash;Eagle will not speak of him:—Grande&ndash;Hâche
knows him, and my brother’s eyes will be
open.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the young chief added a few words in
his own tongue to Baptiste; and making a sign for Wingenund
to follow, he galloped off at speed towards the encampment.</p>

<p>Reginald, surprised, and somewhat inclined to be displeased
by their abrupt departure, turned to the guide, and inquired the
cause of it, and also the meaning of War&ndash;Eagle’s last words.</p>

<p>Baptiste, shaking his head significantly, replied in a low
voice, “I know Mahéga well—at least I have heard much of
him; his name signifies ‘Red&ndash;hand,’ and, as the young chief
says, it tells no lie, for he has killed many: last year he attacked
a war&ndash;party of the Outagamis<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> near the Great River,
and cut them off to a man; he himself killed their chief and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
several of their warriors: they say he is the strongest and the
bravest man in the nation.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Reginald, “that War&ndash;Eagle and he
are not very good friends.”</p>

<p>“They are not,” replied Baptiste; “the young Delaware
has evidently some quarrel with him, and therefore would not
speak of him—we shall learn what it is before many days are
over: meanwhile, Master Reginald, say nothing to any others
of the party on this subject, for they may take alarm, or show
suspicion; and if they do, your summer hunt may chance to
end in rougher play than we expect. I will keep my eye on
‘Red&ndash;hand,’ and will soon tell you what tree he’s making for.”</p>

<p>“Why did they gallop off so abruptly?” inquired Reginald.</p>

<p>“They are gone to rejoin the bands which are coming out
to receive us on our entrance,” replied the guide. “We must
put our party in the best array, and get the presents ready, for
we have not many minutes to spare.”</p>

<p>The event proved the correctness of his calculation; for
they had scarcely time to select from the packs those articles
destined to be presented to the chiefs at this interview, before
they saw two large bands of mounted Indians gallop towards
them from the opposite extremities of the encampment. As they
drew near that which came from the Delaware quarter, and
was headed by War&ndash;Eagle in person, they checked their speed,
and approached slowly; while their leader, advancing in front
of the band, saluted Reginald and his party with dignified
courtesy. Meanwhile the body of Osages continued their
career with headlong speed, shouting, yelling, and going
through all the exciting man&oelig;uvres of a mock fight, after their
wild fashion. Their dress was more scanty and less ornamented
than that of the Delawares; but being tricked out
with painted horsehair, porcupine quills, and feathers, it bore
altogether a more gay and picturesque appearance; neither can
it be denied that they were, in general, better horsemen than
their allies; and they seemed to delight in showing off their
equestrian skill, especially in galloping up to Reginald’s party
at the very top of their speed, and then either halting so suddenly
as to throw their horses quite back upon their haunches,
or dividing off to the right and to the left, and renewing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
man&oelig;uvres in another quarter with increased extravagance of
noise and gesture.</p>

<p>Reginald having learned from Baptiste that this was their
mode of showing honour to guests on their arrival, awaited
patiently the termination of their man&oelig;uvres; and when at
length they ceased, and the Osage party reined their horses up
by the side of the Delawares, he went forward and shook
hands with their leader, a warrior somewhat older than War&ndash;Eagle,
and of a fine martial appearance. As soon as he found
an opportunity, Reginald, turning to Wingenund, who was
close behind him, inquired, in English, if that Osage chief
was Mahéga?</p>

<p>“No,” replied the youth, “that is a brave<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, called in their
tongue the Black&ndash;Wolf. Mahéga,” he added, with a peculiar
smile, “is very different.”</p>

<p>“How mean you, Wingenund?”</p>

<p>“Black&ndash;Wolf,” replied the youth, “is a warrior, and has
no fear, but he is not like Mahéga;—an antelope is not an
elk!”</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on, the party entered
the encampment, and wound their way amongst its scattered
lodges, towards that of Tamenund, where, as the War&ndash;Eagle
informed Reginald, a feast was prepared for his reception, to
which Mahéga and the other Osage leaders were invited.</p>

<p>On arriving before the Great Lodge, Reginald and his companions
dismounted, and giving their horses to the youths in
attendance, shook hands in succession with the principal chiefs
and braves of the two nations. Reginald was much struck by
the benevolent and dignified countenance of the Delaware
chief; but in spite of himself, and of a preconceived dislike
which he was inclined to entertain towards Mahéga, or Red&ndash;hand,
his eye rested on that haughty chieftain with mingled
surprise and admiration. He was nearly a head taller than
those by whom he was surrounded; and his limbs, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
cast in an Herculean mould, showed the symmetrical proportions
which are so distinctive of the North American Indians:
his forehead was bold and high, his nose aquiline, and his
mouth broad, firm, and expressive of most determined character;
his eye was rather small, but bright and piercing as a
hawk’s; his hair had been all shaven from his head, with the
exception of the scalp&ndash;lock on the crown, which was painted
scarlet, and interwoven with a tuft of horsehair dyed of the
same colour. Around his muscular throat was suspended a
collar formed from the claws of the grisly bear, ornamented
with party&ndash;coloured beads, entwined with the delicate fur of
the white ermine; his hunting&ndash;shirt and leggins were of the
finest antelope skin, and his mocassins were adorned with beads
and the stained quills of the porcupine. He leant carelessly
on a bow, which few men in the tribe could bend. At his
back were slung his arrows in a quiver made with wolf&ndash;skin,
so disposed that the grinning visage of the animal was seen
above his shoulder; while a war&ndash;club and scalping&ndash;knife,
fastened to his belt, completed the formidable Mahéga’s
equipment.</p>

<p>As he glanced his eye over the party of white men, there
was an expression of scornful pride on his countenance, which
the quick temper of their youthful leader was ill&ndash;disposed to
brook, had not the prudent counsels of the guide prepared him
for the exercise of self&ndash;command. Nevertheless, as he turned
from the Osage chief to the bulky proportions of his gigantic
follower, Mike Smith, he felt that it was like comparing a lion
with an ox; and that, in the event of a quarrel between them,
the rifle alone could render its issue doubtful.</p>

<p>The feast of welcome was now prepared in the lodge of
Tamenund, which was composed of bison&ndash;skins stretched upon
poles, arranged in the form of a horse&ndash;shoe, and covering an
extent of ground apparently not less than twenty yards in
length. Reginald observed also several smaller lodges immediately
adjoining that of the chief, on one side, and on the
other a circular tent of wax&ndash;cloth, or painted canvasss, evidently
procured from white men, as it was of excellent texture, and
its door, or aperture, protected by double folds of the same
material.</p>

<p>Whilst he was still looking at this comparatively civilised
dwelling, with some curiosity to know by whom it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
tenanted, the folds of the opening were pushed aside, and an
elderly man appeared, who, after contemplating for a moment
the newly&ndash;arrived group, came forward to offer them a friendly
salutation. He was apparently between fifty and sixty; but
his years were not easily guessed, for his snow&ndash;white hair
might seem to have numbered seventy winters; while from
the uprightness of his carriage, and the elasticity of his step,
he seemed scarcely past the vigour of middle life. In figure
he was tall and slight; his countenance, though tanned by
long exposure to the sun, was strikingly attractive, and his
mild blue eye beamed with an expression of benevolence not
to be mistaken. His dress was a black frock of serge, fastened
at the waist by a girdle of the same colour, from which was
suspended a small bag, wherein he carried the few simples and
instruments requisite for his daily offices of charity and kindness.
Dark grey trowsers of the coarsest texture, and mocassins
of buffalo&ndash;hide, completed the dress of Paul Müller, already
mentioned by Wingenund to Reginald as the “Black Father:”
under which name, translated according to their various languages,
the pious and excellent missionary was known among
the Delawares, Osages, Ioways, Otoes, Konsas, and other
tribes then inhabiting the regions lying between the Missouri
and the Arkansas.</p>

<p>Such was the man who now came forward to greet the
newly&ndash;arrived party; and such was the irresistible charm of
his voice and manner, that from the first Reginald felt himself
constrained to love and respect him.</p>

<p>The feast being now ready, and Reginald having pointed
out Baptiste and Bearskin as his officers, or lieutenants, they
were invited with him to sit down in the lodge of Tamenund,
with the principal chiefs of the Delawares, the chief and Great
Medicine&ndash;man<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of the Osages, and the Black Father. (Mike
Smith and the other white men being feasted by a brave in an
adjoining lodge.) The pipe was lighted, and having been
passed twice round the party with silent gravity, the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Medicine&ndash;man made a speech, in which he praised the virtues
and hospitality of Tamenund, and paid many compliments to
the white guests; after which a substantial dinner was set
before them, consisting of roasted buffalo&ndash;ribs, venison, and
boiled maize.</p>

<p>Reginald had never before been present at an Indian feast, and
though he had the appetite naturally belonging to his age and
health, he soon found that he was no match, as a trencherman,
for those among whom he was now placed; and before they
had half finished their meal, he replaced his knife in its sheath,
and announced himself satisfied.</p>

<p>The old chief smiled good&ndash;humouredly, and said that he
would soon do better; whilst Mahéga, quietly commencing an
attack upon a third buffalo&ndash;rib, glanced at him with a look of
contempt, that he was at no pains to conceal, and which, as
may well be imagined, increased our hero’s dislike for the
gigantic Osage.</p>

<p class="pch">REGINALD AND HIS PARTY AT THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT.</p>

<p class="pn">While Reginald and his two companions were feasting with
Tamenund, a similar repast was laid before the rest of the
party, in the lodge of a brave named Maque&ndash;o&ndash;nah, or the
“Bear&ndash;asleep,” at which Mike Smith occupied the centre or
principal seat, and next to him sat Monsieur Perrot,—the
latter personage being very curious to see the culinary arrangements
made for this, his first Indian banquet. He was horrified
at observing the carelessness with which they thrust half
the side of a buffalo to the edge of a huge fire of undried
wood, leaving a portion of the meat to be singed and burnt,
while other parts were scarcely exposed to the heat: he
could not refrain from expressing to one of the Canadian
coureurs des bois, in his own language, his contempt and pity
for the ignorant savages who thus presumed to desecrate a
noble science, which ranked higher, in his estimation, than
poetry, painting, or sculpture: but he was warned that he
must be very careful neither to reject nor show any distaste
for the food set before him, as by so doing he would give
mortal offence to his entertainers. It was ludicrous in the
extreme to watch the poor Frenchman’s attempts at imparting
to his features a smile of satisfaction, when a wooden bowl was
placed before him, filled with half&ndash;boiled maize, and beside it
one of the buffalo&ndash;ribs, evidently less favoured by the fire, as
it was scarcely warmed through, and was tough and stringy
as shoe&ndash;leather. After bestowing upon sundry portions of it
many fruitless attempts at mastication, he contrived, unperceived,
to slip what remained of the meat into the pocket of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
his jacket, and then laughed with great self&ndash;satisfaction at the
trick he had played his uncivilised hosts.</p>

<p>When the feast was concluded in Tamenund’s lodge, Reginald
desired his men to unpack one of the bales, which he
pointed out, and to spread its contents before him; the
savages gathered round the coveted and glittering objects with
eager but silent astonishment, while he separated the presents
which, by the advice of Baptiste, were now distributed among
their chiefs; to Tamenund he apportioned a large blanket of
scarlet cloth, a silver&ndash;mounted pistol, and a basket containing
mirrors, beads, and trinkets, for his wives and daughters; to
Mahéga, a bridle ornamented with beads, several pounds of
tobacco, powder, and lead, a fowling&ndash;piece, and a blanket of
blue woollen&ndash;stuff. The features of the Osage chief relaxed
into a grim smile of satisfaction as he received these valuable
gifts; and he so far overcame the repulsive sternness of his
usual character as to seize Reginald’s hand, and to tell him
that he was a great chief, and good to his Indian brothers.
The other presents having been distributed among the chiefs
and braves, according to their rank, the feast was broken up,
and they retired to their respective lodges; Reginald, Baptiste,
and M. Perrot being accommodated in that of Tamenund’s
himself, and Bearskin, with the rest of the white men’s party,
in those lodges which have before been mentioned as being
contiguous to that of the old chief.</p>

<p>During the first night that he spent in his new quarters,
the excitement and novelty of the scene banished sleep from
the eyes of Reginald; and, finding himself restless, he arose
half an hour before daybreak, to enjoy the early freshness of
the morning. Throwing his rifle over his arm, he was about
to leave the lodge, when Baptiste touched him, and inquired,
in a low voice, if he were prepared with a reply in case of
being challenged by any of the scouts around the encampment;
with some shame he confessed he had forgotten it; and
the guide then instructed him, if he were challenged, to say
“<i>Lenapé n’a ki Netis</i>,” or “I am Netis, the friend of the
Delawares.” Being thus prepared, and carrying with him the
few articles requisite for a Prairie toilet, he stepped out into
the open air. Close by the opening of the lodge, he saw a tall
figure stretched on the grass, enveloped in a buffalo robe, the
hairy fell of which was silvered with the heavy night&ndash;dew: it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
was War&ndash;Eagle, who rarely slept in lodge or tent, and whose
quick eye, though he neither moved nor spoke, discerned his
white brother in a moment, although the latter could not
recognise his friend.</p>

<p>Reginald pursued his way through the encampment to its
extremity, where the streamlet before mentioned wound its
course among the dells and hillocks of the Prairie, until it
reached the larger river that flowed through the distant forest.
After following the banks of the stream for one or two miles,
the red streaks in the eastern horizon gave notice of day’s approach,
and observing near him a hill, somewhat more elevated
than those by which it was surrounded, Reginald climbed to
its top, in order to witness the effect of sunrise on that wild
and picturesque scene.</p>

<p>To the westward, the undulations of the Prairie, wrapped
in heavy folds of mist, rose in confused heaps, like the waves
of a boundless ocean: to the south he could just distinguish
the lodges and the smouldering fires of the encampment,
whence, at intervals, there fell upon his ear mingled and indistinct
sounds, disagreeable perhaps in themselves, but rendered
harmonious by distance, and by their unison with the
wildness of the surrounding objects; while to the eastward
lay a dense and gloomy range of woods, over the summits of
whose foliage the dawning sun was shedding a stream of
golden light.</p>

<p>Reginald gazed upon the scene with wonder and delight;
and every moment while he gazed called into existence richer
and more varied beauties. The mists and exhalations rising
from the plain curled themselves into a thousand fantastic
shapes around the points and projections of the hills, where
they seemed to hang like mantles which the earth had cast
from her bosom, as being rendered unnecessary by the appearance
of the day; swarms of children and of dusky figures
began to emerge from the encampment, and troops of horses
to crop the pasture on the distant hills; while the splendour of
the sun, now risen in its full glory, lit up with a thousand
varying hues the eastern expanse of boundless forest. Reginald’s
heart was not insensible to the impressions naturally
excited by such a scene; and while he admired its variegated
beauties, his thoughts were raised in adoration to that almighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and beneficent Being, whose temple is the earth, and
whose are the “cattle upon a thousand hills.”</p>

<p>Having made his way again to the banks of the stream, and
found a spot sheltered by alder and poplar trees, he bathed
and made his morning toilet; after which he returned towards
the encampment, his body refreshed by his bathe, and his
mind attuned to high and inspiring thoughts by the meditation
in which he had been engaged. As he strolled leisurely
along, he observed a spot where the trees were larger, and the
shade apparently more dense than the other portions of the
valley; and, being anxious to make himself acquainted with
all the localities in the neighbourhood of his new home, he
followed a small beaten path, which, after sundry windings
among the alders, brought him to an open space screened on
three sides by the bushes, and bounded on the fourth by the
stream. Reginald cast his eyes around this pleasant and
secluded spot, until they rested upon an object that riveted
them irresistibly. It was a female figure seated at the root of
an ancient poplar, over a low branch of which one arm was
carelessly thrown, while with the other she held a book, which
she was reading with such fixed attention as to be altogether
unconscious of Reginald’s approach. Her complexion was
dark, but clear and delicate, and the rich brown hair which
fell over her neck and shoulders, still damp and glossy from
her morning ablutions, was parted on her forehead by a
wreath of wild flowers twined from amongst those which
grew around the spot: the contour of her figure, and her unstudied
attitude of repose, realised the classic dreams of
Nymph and Nereid, while her countenance wore an expression
of angelic loveliness, such as Reginald had never seen or
imagined.</p>

<p>He gazed—and gazing on those sweet features, he saw the
red full lips move unconsciously, while they followed the subject
that absorbed her attention; and forgetful that he was
intruding on retirement, he waited, entranced, until those
downcast eyes should be raised. At length she looked up,
and seeing the figure of a man within a few paces of her, she
sprang to her feet with the lightness of a startled antelope;
and darting on him a look of mingled surprise and reproof,
suppressed the exclamation of alarm that rose to her lips.
Reginald would fain have addressed the lovely being before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
him—he would fain have excused his unintended intrusion;
but the words died upon his lips, and it was almost mechanically
that he doffed his hunting&ndash;cap, and stood silent and
uncovered before her! Recovering from the momentary confusion,
she advanced a step towards him, and with an ingenuous
blush held out her hand, saying in a gentle tone of inquiry,
and with the purest accent, “Netis, my brother’s friend?”</p>

<p>“The same, fair creature,” replied Reginald, whose wonder
and admiration were still more excited by the untaught grace
and dignity of her manner, as well as by hearing his own
tongue so sweetly pronounced; “but, in the name of Heaven,
who—what—whence can you be?” Blushing more deeply
at the animation and eagerness of his manner, she was for a
moment silent; when he continued, striking his hand on his
forehead:—“Oh, I have it, fool, tortoise, that I was. You
are ‘Prairie&ndash;bird,’ the sister of whom Wingenund has told
me so much.” Then, gently pressing the little hand which
he had taken, he added, “Dear Wingenund! he saved my
life; his sister will not consider me a stranger?”</p>

<p>Again a warmer blush mantled on the cheek of Prairie&ndash;bird,
as she replied, “You are no stranger: you speak of Wingenund’s
good deed: you are silent about your own! You
drew War&ndash;Eagle from the deep and swift waters. I have
heard it all, and have often wished to see you and thank you
myself.” There was a modest simplicity in her manner, as
she uttered these few words that confirmed the impression
made on Reginald by the first glimpse of her lovely form and
features; but beyond this there was something in the tone of
her voice that found its way direct to his heart; it fell upon
his ear like an old familiar strain of music, and he felt unwilling
to break the silence that followed its closing accents.</p>

<p>It is not our province, in a simple narrative of this kind,
to discuss the oft&ndash;disputed question, whether love at first
sight deserves the name of love; whether it is merely a passing
emotion, which, though apparently strong, a brief lapse
of time may efface; or, whether there be really secret irresistible
natural impulses, by which two human beings, who
meet together for the first time, feel as if they had known and
loved each other for years, and as if the early cherished visions
of fancy, the aspirations of hope, the creations of imagination,
the secret, undefined longings of the heart, were all at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
embodied and realised.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> We are inclined to believe that,
although not frequent, instances sometimes occur of this
instinctive sympathy and attraction, and that, when they do
so, the tree of affection (like the fabled palm at the touch of
the genius’ wand) starts into immediate luxuriance of flower
and foliage, striking its tenacious roots far into the kindly soil,
destined thenceforward to become the nurture of its verdant
youth, the support of its mature strength, and at length the
resting&ndash;place of its leafless and time&ndash;stricken decay.</p>

<p>Such seemed to be the case with Reginald and Prairie&ndash;bird;
for, as they looked one at the other, each was unconsciously
occupied with teeming thoughts that neither could define nor
express, and both felt relieved at hearing approaching footsteps
and the voice of the Black Father, who called out in
English,</p>

<p>“Come, my child, I have allowed you full time this morning;
we will return to the camp.” As he spoke his eye fell
upon Reginald, and he added, courteously, “You have been
early abroad, young sir.”</p>

<p>“I have,” replied Reginald. “I went to the top of yonder
heights to see the sun rise, and was amply repaid by the beauty
of the scene: on my return, I wandered accidentally into
this secluded spot, and trust that my intrusion has been
forgiven.”</p>

<p>“I believe that my dear child and pupil would forgive a
greater offence than that, in one who has shown so much
kindness to her brothers,” replied the missionary, smiling:
and he added, in a low voice, addressing the Prairie&ndash;bird in
his own language, “Indeed, my child, I think he deserves
our friendly welcome; for, unless his countenance strongly
belies his character, it expresses all those good qualities which
Wingenund taught us to expect.”</p>

<p>“Stay, sir,” and Reginald, colouring highly; “let me not
participate, without your knowledge, in your communications
to Prairie&ndash;bird. I have travelled much in Germany, and the
language is familiar to me.”</p>

<p>“Then, my young friend,” said Paul Müller, taking his
hand kindly, “you have only learnt, from what I said, how
hard a task you will have to fulfil the expectations that Wingenund
has led us to entertain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can promise nothing,” replied Reginald, glancing
towards the maiden, “but a true tongue, a ready hand, and
an honest heart; if these can serve my friend’s sister, methinks
she may expect them without being disappointed.”</p>

<p>The words in themselves were nothing remarkable, but
there was an earnest feeling in the tone in which they were
spoken that made Prairie&ndash;bird’s heart beat quicker: she answered
him by a look, but said nothing. Wonderful is the
expression, the magic eloquence of the human eye; and yet
how is its power tenfold increased when the rays of its glance
pass through the atmosphere even of dawning love. Reginald
longed to know whence and who she could be, this child of
the wilderness, who had so suddenly, so irresistibly, engaged
his feelings; above all, he longed to learn whether her heart
and affections were free; and that single look, translated by
the sanguine self&ndash;partiality of love, made him internally exclaim,
“Her heart is not another’s!” Whether his conjecture
proved correct the after&ndash;course of this tale will show: meanwhile
we cannot forbear our admiration at the marvellous
rapidity with which our hero, at his first interview with
Prairie&ndash;bird, settled this point to his own satisfaction. The
little party now strolled towards the camp; and as they went,
Reginald, seeing that Prairie&ndash;bird still held in her hand the
book that he had seen her peruse with so much attention,
said,</p>

<p>“May I inquire the subject of your studies this morning?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she replied, with grave and sweet simplicity;
“it is the subject of my study every morning: the book was
given me by my dear father and instructor now by my side.
I have much to thank him for; all I know, all I enjoy, almost
all I feel, but most of all for this book, which he has taught
me to love, and in some degree to understand.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she placed in Reginald’s hand a small copy of
Luther’s translation of the Bible. In the fly&ndash;leaf before the
title&ndash;page was written, “Given to Prairie&ndash;bird by her loving
father and instructor, Paul Müller.” Reginald read this inscription
half aloud, repeating to himself the words “Müller,”
“father;” and coupling them with the strange enigmas formerly
uttered by Wingenund respecting the origin of Prairie&ndash;bird,
he was lost in conjecture as to their meaning.</p>

<p>“I see your difficulty,” said the missionary, “you do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
understand how she can call Wingenund and War&ndash;Eagle
brothers, and me father. In truth, she has from her earliest
childhood been brought up by Tamenund as his daughter,
and as I reside chiefly with this Delaware band, I have made
it my constant occupation and pleasure to give her such instruction
as my humble means admit; she has been entrusted
to us by the mysterious decrees of Providence; and though
the blood of neither flows in her veins, Tamenund and I have,
according to our respective offices, used our best endeavours
to supply the place of natural parents.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear father,” said Prairie&ndash;bird, pressing his hand
to her lips, and looking up in his face with tearful eyes, “you
are and have been every thing to me,—instructor, comforter,
guide, and father! My Indian father, too, and my brothers,
are all kind and loving to me. I have read in the books that
you have lent me many tales and histories of unkindness and
hatred between parents and children, among nations enlightened
and civilised. I have had every wish gratified before
expressed, and every comfort provided. What could a father
do for a child that you have not done for me?”</p>

<p>As she spoke she looked up in the missionary’s face with
a countenance so beaming with full affection, that the old man
pressed her in his arms, and kissing her forehead, muttered
over her a blessing that he was too much moved to pronounce
aloud; after a pause of a few minutes, he said to Reginald,
with his usual benevolent smile, “We only know you yet by
your Indian name of ‘Netis’—how are you called in the
States? We inquired of War&ndash;Eagle and Wingenund, but
they either did not remember, or could not pronounce your
name?”</p>

<p>“Reginald Brandon,” replied our hero.</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird started, and abruptly said, “Again, again; say
it once more?”</p>

<p>Reginald repeated it, and she pronounced the first name
slowly after him, pressing her hand upon her forehead, and
with her eye fixed on vacancy, while broken exclamations
came from his lips.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of, dear child?” said the missionary,
somewhat surprised and alarmed by her manner.</p>

<p>“Nothing, dear father,” she replied, with a faint smile;
“it was a dream, a strange dream, which that name recalled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and confused my head: we are now close to the camp, I will
go in and rest awhile; perhaps you may like to talk more
with Ne—I mean,” she added, hesitating, “with Reginald.”
So saying, and saluting them with that natural grace which
belonged to all her movements, she withdrew towards the
camp, and Reginald’s eyes followed her retreating figure until
it was lost behind the canvasss folds that protected the opening
to her tent.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">REGINALD HOLDS A CONVERSATION WITH THE MISSIONARY.</p>

<p class="pn">Reginald still kept his eyes on the opening through which
Prairie&ndash;bird had disappeared into the tent, as though they
could have pierced through the canvasss that concealed from his
view its lovely inhabitant: his feelings were in a state of confusion
and excitement, altogether new to him; for if, in his
European travels, he had paid a passing tribute of admiration
to the beauties who had crossed his path, and whom his
remarkable personal advantages had rendered by no means insensible
to his homage, the surface only of his heart had been
touched; whereas now its deepest fountains were stirred, and
the troubled waters gushed forth with overwhelming force.</p>

<p>He was recalled to himself by the voice of the missionary,
who, without appearing to notice his abstraction, said, “My
son, if you choose that we should prolong our walk, I am
ready to accompany you.” If the truth must be told, Reginald
could at that moment scarcely endure the presence of any
human being: he felt an impulse to rush into the woods, or
over the plain, and to pour forth in solitude the torrent of
feelings by which he was oppressed; but he controlled himself,
not only because he really felt a respect for the good missionary,
but also because he hoped through him to obtain some
information respecting the extraordinary being who had taken
such sudden possession of his thoughts: he replied, therefore,
that he would willingly accompany him, and they took their
way together along the banks of the streamlet, alternately observing
on the scenery and surrounding objects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>This desultory conversation did not long suit the eager
and straightforward character of Reginald Brandon; and he
changed it by abruptly inquiring of his companion, whether he
knew any thing of the history and parentage of Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p>“Not much,” replied Paul Müller, smiling; “she was
with this band of Delawares when I first came to reside among
them: if any one knows her history, it must be Tamenund;
but he keeps it a profound secret, and gives out among the
tribe that she was sent to him by the Great Spirit, and that as
long as she remains with the band they will be successful in
hunting and in war.”</p>

<p>“But how,” inquired Reginald, “can he make such a tale
pass current among a people who are well known to consider
the female sex in so inferior and degraded a light?”</p>

<p>“He has effected it,” replied the missionary, “partly by
accident, partly by her extraordinary beauty and endowments,
and partly, I must own, by my assistance, which I have given
because I thereby ensured to her the kindest and most respectful
treatment, and also endeavoured, under God’s blessing, to
make her instrumental in sowing the seed of His truth among
these benighted savages.”</p>

<p>“Let me understand this more in detail,” said Reginald,
“if the narration does not trouble you.”</p>

<p>“Her first appearance among the Delawares, as they have
told me,” said the missionary, was as follows:—“Their prophet,
or Great Medicine&ndash;man, dreamt that under a certain
tree was deposited a treasure, that should enrich the tribe and
render them fortunate: a party was sent by order of the chief
to search the spot indicated; and on their arrival they found a
female child wrapped in a covering of beaver&ndash;skin, and reposing
on a couch of turkey&ndash;feathers: these creatures being supposed
to preside peculiarly over the fate of the Delawares, they
brought back the child with great ceremony to the village,
where they placed her under the care of the chief; set apart a
tent or lodge for her own peculiar use; and ever since that time
have continued to take every care of her comfort and safety.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” interrupted Reginald, “the dream of the
Great Medicine, and all its accompaniments, were secretly arranged
between him and the chief?”</p>

<p>“Probably they were,” replied Paul; “but you must beware
how you say as much to any Delaware: if you did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
risk your life, you would give mortal offence. After all, an
imposition that has resulted in harm to no one, and in so much
good to an interesting and unprotected creature, may be forgiven.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will not gainsay it,” replied our hero: “pray
continue your narrative.”</p>

<p>“My sacred office, and the kindly feelings entertained towards
me by these Indians, gave me frequent opportunities of
seeing and conversing with Olitipa, or the ‘Prairie&ndash;bird;’ and
I found in her such an amiable disposition, and so quick an
apprehension, that I gave my best attention to the cultivation
of talents which might, I hoped, some day produce a harvest
of usefulness. In reading, writing, and in music, she needed
but little instruction. I furnished her from time to time with
books, and paper, and pencils: an old Spanish guitar, probably
taken from some of the dwellings of that people in Missouri,
enabled her to practise simple melodies; and you would be surprised
at the sweetness with which she now sings words, strung
together by herself in English and German, and also in the
Delaware tongue, adapting them to wild airs, either such as she
hears among the Indians, or invents herself. I took especial
pains to instruct her in the practical elements of a science that
my long residence among the different tribes has rendered necessary
and familiar to me,—I mean that of medicine, as connected
with the rude botany of the woods and prairies; and
so well has she profited by my instruction, and by her own
persevering researches, that there is scarcely a tree, or gum, or
herb, possessing any sanatory properties, which she does not
know and apply to the relief of those around her.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Reginald, laughing; “I had not expected
to find this last among the accomplishments of Prairie&ndash;bird.”</p>

<p>“You were mistaken then,” replied Paul Müller; “nay
more, I fear that, in your estimate of what are usually termed
female accomplishments, you have been accustomed to lay too
much stress on those which are light or trifling, and too little
on those which are useful and properly feminine: even
in settled and civilised countries the most grievous fevers
and ailments to which we are subject require the ministration
of a female nurse; can it be then unreasonable that
we should endeavour to mingle in their education some knowledge
of the remedies which they may be called upon to administer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and of the bodily ills which it is to be their province
to alleviate?”</p>

<p>“You are right,” answered Reginald, modestly; “and I
entreat your pardon for the hasty levity with which I spoke
on the subject. I am well aware that, in olden times, no
young woman’s education was held to be complete without
some knowledge both of the culinary and healing arts; and
I much doubt whether society has not suffered from their
having altogether abandoned the cultivation of these in favour
of singing, dancing, and reading of the lightest kind.”</p>

<p>“It is the character of the artificial state to which society is
fast verging,” replied Paul, “to prefer accomplishments to
qualities, ornament to usefulness, luxury to comfort, tinsel
to gold: setting aside the consideration of a future state,
this system might be well enough, if the drawing&ndash;room, the
theatre, and the ball were the sum of human life; but it
is ill calculated to render man dignified in his character,
and useful to his fellow&ndash;creatures, or woman what she ought
to be,—the comfort, the solace, the ornament of home.”</p>

<p>“These observations may be true as regards England or
France,” replied Reginald; “but you surely would not apply
them to our country?”</p>

<p>“To a certain extent, I do,” answered the missionary.
“I have been now thirty years on this continent, and have
observed that, as colonists, the Americans have been very
faithful imitators of these defects in their mother country; I
am not sure that they will be rendered less so by their political
emancipation.”</p>

<p>The conversation was now straying rather too far from the
subject to which Reginald desired to confine it: waving,
therefore, all reply to the missionary’s last observation, he said,
“If I understood you aright, there were, beyond these studies
and accomplishments of Prairie&ndash;bird, some other means employed
by you, to give and preserve to her the extraordinary
influence which you say that she possesses over the Indians.”</p>

<p>“There were,” replied Paul Müller: “amongst others, I
enabled her to vaccinate most of the children in this band, by
which means they escaped the fatal effects of a disorder that
has committed dreadful ravages among the surrounding tribes:
and I have instructed her in some of the elementary calculations
of astronomy; owing to which they look upon her as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
superior being, commissioned by the Great Spirit to live among
them, and to do them good: thus her person is safe, and her
tent as sacred from intrusion as the Great Medicine Lodge. I
am allowed to occupy a compartment in it, where I keep our
little stores of books and medicines; and she goes about the
camp on her errands of benevolence, followed by the attachment
and veneration of all classes and ages!”</p>

<p>“Happy existence!” exclaimed Reginald; “and yet,”
added he, musing, “she cannot, surely, be doomed through
life to waste such sweetness on an air so desert!”</p>

<p>“I know not,” answered the missionary. “God’s purposes
are mysterious, and the instruments that he chooses for effecting
them, various as the flowers on the prairie. Many an
Indian warrior has that sweet child turned from the path of
blood,—more than one uplifted tomahawk has fallen harmless
at the voice of her entreaty; nay, I have reason to hope, that in
Wingenund, and in several others of the tribe, she has partially
uprooted the weeds of hatred and revenge; and sown in their
stead the seeds of gospel truth. Surely, Reginald Brandon,
you would not call such an existence wasted?”</p>

<p>“That would I not, indeed,” replied the young man, with
emphasis. “It is an angel’s office!” he added, inaudibly,
“and it is performed by an angel!”</p>

<p>Although he could have talked or listened on the subject
of the Prairie&ndash;bird for hours together, Reginald began already
to feel that sensitive reserve respecting the mention of her name
to another which always accompanies even the earliest dawnings
of love; and he turned the conversation by inquiring of the
venerable missionary, whether he would kindly communicate
something of his own history; and explain how he had come
from so remote a distance to pass the evening of life among
the Indians.</p>

<p>“The tale is very brief, and the motives very simple. I
was born in Germany, and having early embraced the tenets
of the United Brethren, of whom you have probably heard in
that country under the name of ‘Herrn&ndash;Hüter,’ I received a
pressing invitation from Heckewelder, then in England, to join
him in his projected missionary journey to North America.
I gladly accepted the offer, and after a short stay in London,
embarked with that learned and amiable man,—who soon
became what he now is, the nearest and dearest friend I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
on earth;—and I placed myself under his guidance in the
prosecution of the grand objects of our undertaking, which
were these—to endeavour to convert the Indian nations to
Christianity, not, as the Spaniards had pretended to attempt,
by fire, and sword, and violence; but by going unarmed and
peaceably among them, studying their languages, characters,
and history; and while showing in our own persons an example
of piety and self&ndash;denial, to eradicate patiently the more noxious
plants from their moral constitution, and to mould such as
were good and wholesome to the purposes of religious truth.
God be praised, our labours have not been altogether without
effect; but I blush for my white brethren when I confess that
the greatest obstacle to our success has been found in the vices,
the open profligacy, the violence, and the cruelty of those who
have called themselves Christians. Heckewalder has confined
his exertions chiefly to the Indians remaining in Pennsylvania
and the Western territory; mine have been mostly employed
among the wandering and wilder tribes who inhabit this remote
and boundless region.”</p>

<p>“I have often heard your pious friend’s name,” said Reginald;
“he enjoys the reputation of being the most eminent
Indian linguist in our country, and he is supposed to know the
Delaware language as well as his own.”</p>

<p>“He is indeed,” said Paul, “the most skilful and successful
labourer in this rude but not unfruitful vineyard. Now and
then, at remote intervals, I contrive, by means of some
returning hunter or Indian agent, to communicate with him,
and his letters always afford me matter of consolation and
encouragement; though I was much cast down when he
announced to me the cruel and wanton massacre of his Indian
flock near the banks of the Ohio.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of it,” replied Reginald; “I regret to say
that the outrage was committed not very far from the spot
where my father lives.”</p>

<p>“Do you live in that neighbourhood?” exclaimed the missionary,
suddenly catching his arm; “then you may, perhaps,—but
no, it cannot be,” he muttered to himself; “this
youth can know nothing of it—“</p>

<p>“My honoured friend,” replied Reginald, colouring at the
idea suggested by the words which he had overheard, “I
trust you do not believe that my father, or any of my kindred,
had a share in those atrocities!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“You misunderstood me altogether, I assure you,” answered
the missionary; “my exclamation had reference to another
subject. But I see War&ndash;Eagle coming this way; probably he
is bent upon some hunting excursion, in which you may wish
to be his companion.”</p>

<p>“I shall gladly do so,” replied Reginald, “as soon as I
have breakfasted: my faithful follower, Perrot, desired very
much that I should taste some collops of venison, which he
said that he could dress in a style somewhat superior to that
of the Indian cookery. Will you share them with me?”</p>

<p>The missionary excused himself, as he had already taken
his morning meal, and was about to return to the tent of Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p>Reginald assured the good man of the pleasure which he
had found in his conversation, and expressed a hope that he
would be enabled soon to enjoy it again, as there was much
information respecting the habits, religion, and character of the
different Indian tribes which he felt anxious to acquire, and
which none could be better able to communicate.</p>

<p>“Whatever instruction or information I may have collected
during my residence among them, is freely at your service,”
replied Paul Müller; “and if you find yourself in any difficulty
or embarrassment where my advice can be of use, you
may always command it. You know,” he added, smiling,
“they consider me Great Medicine, and thus I am able to say
and do many things among them which would not be permitted
in another white man.” So saying, he shook hands with Reginald,
and returned slowly towards the encampment.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle now came up, and greeting his friend with his
usual cordiality, inquired whether he would accompany him in
the chase of the elk, herds of which had been seen at no great
distance. Reginald acceded to the proposal; and, having hastily
dispatched the collops prepared by Perrot, the two friends
left the village on foot, and took their way towards the timber
in the valley.</p>

<p>The day was hot, and the speed at which the agile Indian
unconsciously strode along, would have soon discomfited a less
active pedestrian than Reginald; but having been well seasoned
in his hunting excursions with Baptiste, he found no difficulty
in keeping pace with his friend; and he amused himself, as
they went, by asking him a variety of questions respecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
country, the tribe, and its language, to all of which War&ndash;Eagle
replied with much intelligence and candour.</p>

<p>As Reginald had not seen Wingenund, he asked his companion
how it happened that the youth did not accompany
them. “He is gone,” replied War&ndash;Eagle, “to bring turkeys
to the camp.”</p>

<p>“Does he shoot them?” inquired Reginald.</p>

<p>“No, he takes them—my white brother shall see; it is
not far from the Elk Path.”</p>

<p>When they reached the wooded bottom, War&ndash;Eagle struck
into a small track which seemed to have been made by a
streamlet in spring, and having followed it for about a mile,
they came to a more open woodland scene, where the Indian
pointed, as they passed along, to scattered feathers, and foot&ndash;tracks
of turkeys in abundance. They had not proceeded far,
when he uttered a low exclamation of surprise as he discovered
Wingenund stretched at the foot of a tree, with his eyes busily
fixed upon something which he held in his hand, and which
so riveted his attention that he was not aware of their approach.
Beside him lay two old and two young turkeys, which he had
caught and killed: the friends had not looked at him many
seconds, before he raised his eyes and perceived them: starting
to his feet, he made an ineffectual attempt to conceal that
which he had been holding in his hand, which was, in fact,
a sheet of coarse white paper. Reginald drew near and said
to him, “Come, Wingenund, you must show Netis what you
hold in your hand: I am sure it is no harm; and if it is a
secret, I will keep it.”</p>

<p>Wingenund, in some confusion, handed the scroll to Reginald,
who saw at the first glance that it was a fragment of an
elementary vocabulary of Delaware and English words, written
in a free bold character: he ran his eye over the paper, which
contained chiefly phrases of the most simple kind, such as,
“<i>N’menne</i>, I drink,” “<i>N’ani pa wi</i>, I stand,” “<i>Tokelân</i>, it
rains,” “<i>Loo</i>, true,” “<i>Yuni</i>, this,” “<i>Na&ndash;ni</i>, that,” &amp;c. &amp;c.,
and a smile came over his features when his eye met his own
name, “Netis,” with its translation, “dear friend.” Below
this he read, “N’quti,” “Nisha,” “Nacha,” “Newo,” and a
succession of single words, which he rightly conjectured to be
numerals, 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c., and at the bottom of the page was
a long sentence in the Lenapé tongue, which began as follows:—“<i>Ki wetochemelenk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
talli epian awassagame</i>, &amp;c.”—“What
is this last sentence, Wingenund?” inquired Reginald.</p>

<p>“It is the prayer,” replied the youth, “that the Good Spirit
taught the white men to say, when he came to live among
them.”</p>

<p>“And who wrote all these words for you?”</p>

<p>“Prairie&ndash;bird wrote them, and every day she teaches me to
understand the marks on the paper.”</p>

<p>Reginald’s eyes strayed unconsciously to that part of the
sheet where he had seen his own name written by the Prairie&ndash;bird’s
hand. “Happy boy!” he mentally ejaculated, “to sit
at her feet, and draw instruction from her lips!”—“With such
a teacher, methinks I could learn the Lenapé tongue in a
month!—What says my brother?” continued he aloud,
addressing War&ndash;Eagle, whose fine countenance wore an expression
of indifference, almost amounting to contempt. “What
says my brother of this paper?”</p>

<p>“It is perhaps good,” replied the Indian gravely, “for
the Black Father, and for the white man—but not for the
Lenapé. The Great Spirit has given him a heart to feel,
and a hand to fight, and eyes to see the smallest track on the
grass—that is enough. Our fathers knew no more, and they
were great, and strong, and brave!—chiefs among the nations!
What are we now? Few, and weak, and wandering. It is
better for us to live and die like them, and we shall hunt with
them in the happy fields.—Let us go and show Netis where
Wingenund takes the turkeys.” So saying, he turned and led
the way, followed by his two companions.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN ARRIVAL AT MOOSHANNE.—A CALM ASHORE AFTER A STORM
AT SEA.</p>

<p class="pn">While the events, narrated in the preceding chapter, were
occurring in the Western wilderness, the family at Mooshanne
had been thrown into a state of the greatest dismay
and confusion, by the arrival of Captain L’Estrange’s first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
letter announcing the flight of Ethelston with his daughter,
and depicting his conduct in the blackest colours. Colonel
Brandon had perused its contents half a dozen times, and
they had produced traces of anxiety upon his countenance, too
evident to escape the observation of Lucy, so that he was
obliged to break to her by degrees the painful intelligence of
her lover’s infidelity: with a calmness that surprised him, she
insisted on reading the letter; as she proceeded her brow
crimsoned with indignation, and those blue eyes, usually
beaming with the gentlest expression, flashed with an angry
lustre.</p>

<p>Colonel Brandon knew full well the affection she had long
conceived for Ethelston, and though his own feelings were
deeply wounded by the misconduct of one whom he had loved
and trusted as a son, they were at present overpowered by
the fears which he entertained of the effect which this
unexpected blow might produce on Lucy’s health and happiness.
He was, therefore, relieved by observing the anger
expressed on her countenance, and prepared himself to hear
the deserved reproaches on her former lover, which seemed
ready to burst from her tongue. What was his surprise when
he saw her tear the letter in pieces before his face, and heard
her, while she set her pretty little foot upon them, exclaim,</p>

<p>“Dear, dear father, how could you for a moment believe
such a tale of vile, atrocious falsehood?”</p>

<p>However disinclined the Colonel might be to believe any
thing to the disadvantage of Ethelston, there was so much
circumstantial evidence to condemn him, that he felt it his
duty to prepare his child for the worst at once, and to point
out to her how they already knew that Ethelston had been
wounded and conveyed to the house of L’Estrange, that his
long absence was unexplained, and lastly that the character of
the French commodore, as an officer, and a man of honour,
was unimpeached.</p>

<p>Lucy heard him to the end; the glow on her cheek assumed a
warmer hue, and the little foot beat with a nervous and
scarcely perceptible motion on the floor, as she replied, “Father
I will believe that the letter is a forgery, or that the French
officer, or commodore, or admiral, is a madman, but never
that Ethelston is a villain.”</p>

<p>“My dear Lucy,” said the Colonel, “I am almost as unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to think ill of Ethelston as you can be yourself; but
alas! I have seen more than you of the inconstancy of men;
and I know, too well, that many who have enjoyed a good
reputation have yet been found unable to withstand temptation,
such as may have beset Ethelston while an inmate of the
same house with the Creole beauty—“</p>

<p>“Dear father,” answered Lucy, colouring yet more deeply;
“though it were possible that Ethelston, in the presence of
greater attractions, may have yielded to them his affections,
and withdrawn them from one who had hoped to possess and
treasure them for life,—though this may be possible, it is not
possible that he should be guilty of a violation of the laws
of hospitality and honour, such as that slanderous paper lays
to his charge. Promise me, dearest father, to suspend your
belief, and never to speak on this subject again, until it is
God’s pleasure that the truth shall be brought to light.”</p>

<p>“I promise you, my sweet child,” said her father; “and
may that merciful Being grant that your trust be not disappointed!”</p>

<p>“I have no fears,” said Lucy; and, as she spoke, her eyes
beamed with that full undoubting love such as can only be
felt by one who has never known what it is to deceive or to be
deceived.</p>

<p>Days and weeks passed on without any intelligence of
Ethelston; and while the fears of Colonel Brandon became
more confirmed, the agony of suspense and the sickness of
deferred hope began to prey upon the spirits of his daughter:
she never alluded to the forbidden subject; but her nervous
anxiety, when the weekly letter&ndash;bag was opened, clearly showed
that it was ever in her mind: nevertheless she continued her
occasional excursions to Marietta, and visited, as usual, those
around Mooshanne who were sick or in distress; so that neither
her mother nor Aunt Mary detected the anxiety by which she
was tortured. One evening, half an hour before sunset, as
the family party were seated at their simple supper, the clatter
of a horse’s hoofs was heard approaching at full speed, from
which the rider dismounted, and, lifting the latch of the unlocked
door, entered the house. Traversing the vestibule with
hasty strides, and apparently guided by instinct to the apartment
in which the family were assembled, he threw open the
door, and Ethelston stood before the astonished party. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
countenance was haggard from fatigue and exposure to the
sun, and his whole appearance indicated exhaustion. Lucy
turned deadly pale, and Colonel Brandon’s constrained manner,
as he rose from his chair, must have convinced the new comer
that his return was productive of other feelings than those of
unmingled pleasure. He was moving, however, a few steps
forward to pay his first respects to Mrs. Brandon, when the
Colonel, touching him lightly on the arm, said, “Mr. Ethelston,
I must crave a few words with you in the adjoining
room.”</p>

<p>Hitherto Lucy had remained silent, with her eyes fixed
intently on Ethelston’s countenance; he returned her look with
one as long and fixed: the expression of his eyes was mournful,
rather than joyous, but there was no trace of uneasiness
or of shame. Springing from her seat, she placed her hand
imploringly on the Colonel’s arm saying,</p>

<p>“Dear father, I told you so from the first,—I knew it
always—I read it now plain as the sun in heaven,—that vile
letter <i>was</i> a string of falsehoods;—he is returned as he left
us, with an untarnished honour.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear Lucy,” said Ethelston, advancing and
pressing her extended hands to his lips: “blessings on that
trusting affection which has rendered it impossible for you to
believe aught to the prejudice of one on whom you have
deigned to fix it. Colonel Brandon,” he continued, “I can
guess how you have been misled, and appearances were for
a short time so much against me, that I acquit of all intentional
malice those who have misled you. Judge for yourself
whether, if I were stained by the crime of which I have
been accused, I could now ask, on my bended knee, for the
blessing of you, my second father, and thus hold in mine, as
I dare to do, the hand of your pure, trusting, and beloved
child.”</p>

<p>There was a truth in every tone of his voice, and a convincing
dignity in his manner, that swept away all doubts
like a torrent. The Colonel embraced him with cordial affection;
Aunt Mary kissed her favourite nephew over and over
again; Mrs. Brandon wept tears of joy on his neck; and Lucy
was so overpowered by delight, that she was perhaps scarcely
conscious of all that passed around.</p>

<p>After they were in some degree recovered from their emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and had pressed Ethelston to take some refreshment, he
said to the Colonel, “Now I am prepared to give you an
account of my adventures, and to explain those circumstances
that led to the misunderstanding under which you have so
long laboured.”</p>

<p>“Not a word—not a word will I hear of explanation
to&ndash;night, my dear boy,” replied the Colonel. “I am already
ashamed that I have not shown the same undoubting confidence
in your rectitude, both of purpose and conduct, that
has been evinced from first to last by Lucy. You are weary
and exhausted; the agitation of this scene has been trying to
all of us; we will defer your narrative until to&ndash;morrow. Our
first duty this evening is to return our thanks to Providence
for having protected you through all danger, and restored you
safe to the comforts of home.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the worthy old gentleman took down a Bible
from the shelf; and having desired Lucy to summon all the
servants into the room, he read an appropriate chapter, and
added to the selected prayer for the evening a few impressive
and affecting words of thanksgiving, for the safe return of the
long&ndash;lost member of the family.</p>

<p>This duty was scarcely concluded, when the outer door
was violently opened; a heavy step was heard approaching,
and, without waiting to be admitted or announced, the sturdy
figure of Gregson entered the room.</p>

<p>“The captain himself, as I live!” said the honest mate.
“Beg pardon, Colonel Brandon, but I heard a report of his
having been seen going ten knots an hour through Marietta.
So up I sticks, made sail, and was in his wake in less time
than our nigger cook takes to toss off a glass of grog.”</p>

<p>“Give me your hand, Gregson,” said Ethelston, kindly;
“there is not a truer nor an honester one between Marietta
and China.”</p>

<p>“Thank ye, thank ye, captain,” said the mate, giving him
a squeeze that would have broken the knuckles of any hand
but a sailor’s; “the flipper’s well enough in its way, and
I trust the heart’s somewhere about the right place; but
what the devil have they been at with you in Guadaloupe?”
added he, observing his chief’s wearied and wasted
appearance; “considering how long those rascally Frenchmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
have had you in dock, they’ve sent you to sea in precious
state, both as to hull and rigging.”</p>

<p>“I confess, I am not over ship&ndash;shape,” said Ethelston,
laughing; “but my present condition is more owing to the
fatigues of my tedious journey from New Orleans than to any
neglect on the part of the Frenchmen.”</p>

<p>The Colonel now invited the worthy mate to be seated; and
Lucy brewed for him, with her own fair fingers a large
tumbler of toddy, into which, by her father’s desire, she
poured an extra glass of rum. Ethelston, pretending to be
jealous of this favour, insisted on his right to a draught, containing
less potent ingredients, but administered by the same
hand; and an animated conversation ensued, in the course of
which Gregson inquired after the welfare of his old friend
Cupid, the black cook.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow, he is no more,” replied Ethelston, in a tone
of deep feeling; “he died as he had lived, proud, brave,
faithful to the last. I cannot tell you the story now, it is too
sad a one for this our first evening at home:” as he spoke,
his eyes met those of Lucy, and there he read all that his
overcharged heart desired to know.</p>

<p>Soon after the allusion to this melancholy incident, the little
party broke up; the evening being already far advanced,
Gregson returned to Marietta, and the members of the Colonel’s
family retired to their respective apartments, leaving Ethelston
alone in the drawing&ndash;room. For a few minutes he walked up
and down, and pressed his hand upon his forehead, which
throbbed with various and deep emotions. He took up the
music whereon Lucy had written her name, and the needlework
on which her fingers had been employed: he sat down
on the chair she had just left, as if to satisfy himself with
the assurance that all around him was not a dream; and again
he vented the full gratitude of his heart in a brief but earnest
ejaculation of thanksgiving. After a short indulgence in such
meditations, he retired to that rest of which he stood so much
in need. The room that had been prepared for him was up
stairs, and, on crossing a broad passage that led to it, he
suddenly met Lucy, who was returning to her own from her
mother’s apartment. Whether this meeting was purely accidental,
or whether Lucy, remembering that she had not said
good&ndash;night quite distinctly to her lover, lingered in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
mother’s room until she heard his step on the stair, we have
no means of ascertaining, and therefore leave it undecided:
certain it is, however, that they did meet in the passage above
mentioned, and that Ethelston, putting down his candle on a
table that stood by, took Lucy’s unresisting hand and pressed
it in his own: he gazed on her blushing countenance with an
intensity that can only be understood by those who, like him,
have been suddenly restored to a beloved one, whose image
had been ever present during a long absence, assuaging the
pain of sickness, comforting him in trials, dwelling with him
in the solitude of a prison, and sustaining him in the extremest
perils of the storm, the fight, and the shipwreck! Though he
had never been formally betrothed to her in words, and though
his heart was now too full to give utterance to them, he had
heard enough below to satisfy him that she had never doubted
his faith—he felt that their troth was tacitly plighted to each
other, and now it was almost unconsciously that their lips met
and sealed the unspoken contract.</p>

<p>That first, long, passionate kiss of requited love! Its
raptures have been the theme of glowing prose, of impassioned
verse, in all ages and climes; the powers of language have
been exhausted upon it, the tongue and the pen of genius
have, for centuries, borrowed for its description the warmest
hues of fancy and imagination—and yet how far short do
they fall of the reality! how impossible to express in words
an electric torrent of feeling, more tumultuous than joy, more
burning than the desert’s thirst,—yet sweeter and more delicious
than childhood’s dream of Paradise, pouring over the
heart a stream of bliss, steeping the senses in oblivion of all
earthly cares, and so mysteriously blending the physical with
the immaterial elements of our nature, that we feel as if, in
that embrace, we could transfuse a portion of our soul and
spirit into the beloved object on whose lip that first kiss of
long&ndash;treasured love is imprinted.</p>

<p>Brief and fleeting moments! they are gone almost before
the mind is conscious of them! They could not, indeed, be
otherwise than brief, for the agony of joy is like that of pain,
and exhausted nature would sink under its continued excess.
Precious moments, indeed! to none can they be known more
than once in life; to very many, they can never be known at
all. They can neither be felt nor imagined by the mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
worldling, nor the sensualist; the sources of that stream of
bliss must be unadulterated by aught low, or selfish; it is not
enough that</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">“Heart and soul and sense in concert move:”</p>

<p class="pn1">desire must go hand in hand with purity, and virtue be the
handmaid of passion, or the blissful scene will lose its fairest
and brightest hues.</p>

<p>The step of some servant was heard approaching; and
Lucy, uttering a hasty good&ndash;night, returned to her room,
where she bolted her door, and gave herself up to the varied
emotions by which she was overcome. Tears bedewed her
eyes, but they were not tears of grief; her bosom was agitated,
but it was not the agitation of sorrow; her pillow was sleepless,
but she courted not slumber, for her mind dwelt on the
events of the past day; and gratitude for her lover’s return,
together with the full assurance of his untarnished honour,
and undiminished affection, rendered her waking thoughts
sweeter than any that sleep could have borrowed from the
land of dreams.</p>

<p>On the following morning, after breakfast, when the family
were assembled in the library, Ethelston, at the request of
Colonel Brandon, commenced the narrative of his adventures.
As the reader is already acquainted with them, until the
closing scene of poor Nina’s life, we shall make mention of
that part of his tale no further than to state that, so far as
truth would permit, in all that he told, as well as all that he
forbore to tell, he feelingly endeavoured to shield her memory
from blame; the sequel of his story we shall give in his own
words.</p>

<p>“I remained only a few days with L’Estrange after his
daughter’s death; during which time I used my best endeavours
to console him; but, in spite of the affectionate kindness
which he showed me, I felt that my presence must ever recall
and refresh the remembrance of his bereavement, and I was
much relieved when the arrival of one of his other married
daughters, with her family, gave me an excuse and an opportunity
for withdrawing from Guadaloupe. The vessel which
had brought them from Jamaica proposed to return immediately,
and I easily obtained L’Estrange’s permission to sail
with her, only on the condition of not serving against France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
during the continuance of these hostilities: when I bade him
farewell he was much affected, and embraced me as if he were
parting with a son; so I have at least the melancholy satisfaction
of knowing that I retain his best wishes and his esteem.</p>

<p>“My voyage to Port Royal was prosperous. On arriving
I found a brig laden with fruit, just about to sail in a few
days for New Orleans. I confess I did not much like the
appearance either of the vessel or her commander; but such
was my impatience to return to Mooshanne, that I believe I
would have risked the voyage in an open boat.” Here Ethelston
looked at Lucy, on whose countenance a blushing smile
showed that she well knew the meaning of his words. “I
embarked,” continued he, “accompanied by my faithful
Cupid, on board the Dos Amigos: the captain was an
ignorant rum&ndash;drinking Creole; besides himself there was only
one white man in the crew, and the coloured men were from
all countries and climates, the most reckless and turbulent
gang that I had ever seen on board a ship. During the first
half of the voyage, the weather being favourable, we crept
along the southern coast of Cuba, and passed almost within
sight of the Isla de Pinos, which I had so much cause to remember;
thence we steered a north&ndash;westerly course, and
doubled the Cape of Saint Antonio in safety, whence we had
a prospect of a fair run to the Belise; but, two days after we
had lost sight of the Cuban coast, it came on to blow a gale of
wind, which gradually increased until it became almost a hurricane
from the south&ndash;west.</p>

<p>“The brig drove helplessly before it; and from her leaky and
shattered condition, as well as from the total want of seamanship
exhibited by her drunken captain, I hourly expected that
she would founder at sea: for twenty&ndash;four hours the gale continued
with unabated violence, and the weather was so thick
that no object could be discerned at two hundred yards’ distance.
I remained constantly on deck, giving such assistance
as I could render, and endeavouring to keep the captain’s
lips from the rum&ndash;bottle, to which he had more frequent recourse
as the danger became more imminent. Being at length
wearied out, I threw myself in my clothes on my cot, and soon
fell asleep. I know not how long I slept; but I was awakened
by a violent shock, accompanied by a grating, grinding sound,
from which I knew in an instant that the brig had struck on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a rock. Almost before I had time to spring from my cot, Cupid
dashed into the cabin, and, seizing me with the force of a
giant, dragged me on deck. At this moment the foremast fell
with a tremendous crash, and a heavy sea swept over the devoted
vessel, carrying away the boat, all loose spars, and many
of the crew. Cupid and I held on by the main rigging, and
were not swept away; but wave after wave succeeded each
other with resistless fury, and in a few moments we were both
struggling, half stunned and exhausted, in the abyss of waters,
holding on convulsively to a large hencoop, which had providentially
been thrown between us.</p>

<p>“One wild shriek of despair reached my ear, after which
nothing was heard but the tumultuous roar of the angry elements.”</p>

<p>At this part of Ethelston’s narrative, Lucy covered her face
with her hands, as if she would thereby shut out the dreadful
view, and in spite of all her struggle for self&ndash;command, a tear
stole down her colourless cheek.</p>

<p>“It was, indeed, a fearful moment,” he continued, “and
yet I did not feel deserted by hope; I was prepared for death,
I prayed fervently, and I felt that my prayer was not unheard;
even then, in that strife of foaming sea and roaring blast, God
sent the vision of an angel to comfort and sustain me! It
wore the form of one who has ever dwelt in my thoughts by
day, and in my dreams by night; who seemed as near to me
then, as she does now that her gentle tears are flowing at this
recital of my trials.”</p>

<p>While speaking the last words, his low voice trembled until
it fell into a whisper, and Lucy, overcome by her feelings,
would have fallen from her chair, had not his ready arm supported
her. A dead silence reigned in the room; Aunt Mary
wept aloud, and Colonel Brandon walked to the window to
conceal his emotion. After a few minutes, as he turned again
towards them, Ethelston, who still supported Lucy, beckoned
him to approach, and, addressing him in a tone of deep and
earnest feeling, said,</p>

<p>“Colonel Brandon, my guardian, friend, and benefactor;
add yet this one to all your former benefits, and my cup of
gratitude will be full indeed:” as he spoke he took the unresisting
hand of Lucy in his own: the Colonel looked inquiringly
and affectionately at his daughter, who did not speak, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
raised her tearful eyes to his, with an expression not to be
misunderstood. Pressing their united hands between his own,
and kissing Lucy’s forehead, he whispered,</p>

<p>“God bless you, my children:” after a pause he added,
with a suppressed smile, “Ethelston shall finish his narrative
presently;” and, taking Aunt Mary’s arm, he left the room.</p>

<p>We will imitate the Colonel’s discretion, and forbear to
intrude upon the sacred quiet of a scene where the secret,
long&ndash;cherished love of two overflowing hearts was at length
unreservedly interchanged; we need only say that ere the
Colonel returned with Aunt Mary, after an absence of half an
hour, Lucy’s tears were dried, and her cheeks were suffused
with a mantling blush, as she sprung into her father’s arms,
and held him in a long and silent embrace.</p>

<p>“Come, my child,” said the Colonel, when he had returned
her affectionate caress: “sit down, and let us hear the conclusion
of Ethelston’s adventures—we left him in a perilous
plight, and I am anxious to hear how he escaped from it.”</p>

<p>“Not without much suffering, both of mind and body, my
dear sir,” continued Ethelston in a serious tone of voice; “for
the sea dashed to and fro with such violence the frail basket&ndash;work
to which Cupid and I were clinging, that more than
once I was almost forced to quit my hold, and it was soon
evident that its buoyant power was not sufficient to save us
both, especially as Cupid’s bulk and weight were commensurate
with his gigantic strength. His coolness under these
trying circumstances was remarkable: observing that I was
almost fainting from the effects of a severe blow on the head
from a floating piece of the wreck, he poured into my mouth
some rum from a small flask that he had contrived to secure,
and then replacing the stopper, he thrust the flask into my
breast pocket, saying, ‘Capt’n drink more when he want:’
at this moment a large spar from the wreck was driven past
us, and the faithful creature said, ‘Capt’n, hencoop not big
enough for two, Cupid swim and take spar to ride;’ and, ere I
could stop him, he loosed his hold and plunged into the huge
wave to seize the spar: more I could not see, for the spray
dashed over me, and the gloom and the breakers hid him in a
moment from my sight. I felt my strength failing, but
enough remained for me to loose a strong silk kerchief from
my neck, and to lash myself firmly to the hencoop. Again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and again the wild sea broke over me; I felt a tremendous
and stunning blow—as I thought, the last, and I was no
more conscious of what passed around.</p>

<p>“When I recovered my senses, I found myself lying upon
some soft branches, and sheltered by low bushes, a few hundred
yards from the sea&ndash;beach; two strange men were standing near
me, and gave evident signs of satisfaction when they saw my
first attempts at speech and motion; they made me swallow
several morsels of sea&ndash;biscuit steeped in rum, and I was soon
so far restored as to be able to sit up, and to learn the particulars
of my situation. The island near which the brig had
been wrecked, was one of the Tortugas; the two men who
had carried me up to a dry spot from the beach, belonged
to a small fishing&ndash;craft, which had put in two days before the
hurricane for a supply of water and in hopes of catching
turtle. Their vessel was securely moored in a little natural
harbour, protected by the outer ledge of rocks: the reef on
which the brig had struck was upwards of a mile from the
spot where they had found me; and I could not learn from
them that they had seen any portion of her wreck, or any part
of her crew, alive or dead.</p>

<p>“As soon as my bruised condition permitted me to drag my
limbs along, I commenced a careful search along the low rocky
shore, in hopes of learning something of the fate of Cupid,
and at length was horrified on discovering the mutilated
remains of the faithful creature, among some crevices in the
rocks. He had clung to the spar which still lay beside him
with the pertinacious strength of despair: his hands and
limbs were dreadfully mangled, and his skull fractured by the
violence with which he had been driven on the reef. I remembered
how he had resigned the hencoop to save my life;
and the grief that I evinced for his loss moved the compassion
of the fishermen, who aided me to bury him decently on the
island.</p>

<p>“We remained there two days longer, until the gale had
subsided, during which time I frequently visited poor Cupid’s
grave; and though many of our countrymen would be ashamed
of owning such regret for one of his colour, I confess that
when on that lonely spot I called to mind his faithful services,
and his last noble act of generous courage, I mourned him as
a friend and brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“When the fishing&ndash;smack put to sea, I prevailed on her
captain to visit the reef where the brig had struck; but we
found not a spar nor plank remaining; nor am I to this
moment aware whether any others of her crew survived the
wreck; but it is more than probable that they perished to
a man. Upon the promise of a considerable sum of money,
I prevailed upon the fishermen to give me a passage to New
Orleans, where we arrived without accident or adventure, and
my impatience to reach home only permitted me to stay in
that city a few hours, when, having provided myself with
a horse, I rode on hither by forced marches, and arrived in
the travel&ndash;worn condition that you observed yesterday.”</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN ELK&ndash;HUNT.—REGINALD MAKES HIS FIRST ESSAY IN SURGERY.—THE
READER IS ADMITTED INTO PRAIRIE&ndash;BIRD’S TENT.</p>

<p class="pn">We left Reginald Brandon in the skirt of the forest bounding
the Western Prairie, accompanied by Wingenund and War&ndash;Eagle.
The latter, having taken the lead, conducted his companions
through a considerable extent of ground, covered with
bushes of alder and scrub&ndash;oak, until they reached an open forest
glade, where the Indian pointed out to Reginald a large square
building, composed of rough logs, and covered with the same
material. In the centre of one side was a low aperture, or
door, about fifteen inches in height, in front of which was a
train of maize laid by Wingenund. On approaching this turkey&ndash;pen,
or trap, they observed that there were already two
prisoners, a large gobbler and a female bird, although not
more than an hour had elapsed since the lad had taken out
the four turkeys which have been before mentioned. When
the captives became aware of the approach of the party, they
ran about the pen from side to side, thrusting out their long
necks, peering through the crevices in the logs, jumping and
flying against the top, in their violent endeavours to escape.</p>

<p>“Do they never stoop their heads?” inquired Reginald,
“and go out at the same door by which they entered?”</p>

<p>“Never,” replied Wingenund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is singular,” said Reginald, “for the bird is in
general very sagacious and difficult to be taken or killed;—how
does it happen that they are so unaccountably stupid as
not to go out where they came in?”</p>

<p>Before answering the question addressed to him, Wingenund
cast a diffident look towards War&ndash;Eagle, and on receiving from
the chief a sign to reply, he said,</p>

<p>“Netis knows that the Great Spirit distributes the gifts of
wisdom and cunning like the sunshine and the storm; even the
Black Father does not understand all his ways. How can
Wingenund tell why the turkey’s eye is so quick, his ear so
sharp, his legs so swift?—and yet he is sometimes a fool;
when he picks up the maize, his head is low; he walks through
the opening; he is in a strange place; he is frightened; and
fear takes from him all the sense that the Great Spirit had
given him. Wingenund knows no more.”</p>

<p>“My young brother speaks truly, and wisely, beyond his
years,” said Reginald, kindly. “It is, as you say, fear makes
him forget all the capacities of his nature: it is so with men,
why should it be otherwise with birds? Does War&ndash;Eagle say
nothing?”</p>

<p>“My brother’s words are true,” replied the chief, gravely;
“he has picked out one arrow, but many remain in the quiver.”</p>

<p>“My brother speaks riddles,” said Reginald; “I do not
understand him.”</p>

<p>“Fear is a bad spirit,” replied the chief, raising his arm,
and speaking with energy. “It creeps round the heart of a
woman, and crawls among the lodges of the Dahcotahs; it
makes the deer leap into the river when he would be safer in
the thicket; it makes the turkey a fool, and keeps him in the
pen: but there are other bad spirits, that make the heart crooked
and the eyes blind.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how so?” inquired Reginald, desirous of encouraging
his Indian friend to continue his illustration.</p>

<p>“Does my brother know the antelope,” replied War&ndash;Eagle;
“he is very cunning and swift; his eye is quick as the turkey’s;
the hunter could not overtake him: but he lies down in
a hollow and hides himself; he fastens a tuft of grass to his
bow and holds it over his head; the Bad Spirit gets into the
antelope; he becomes a fool; he comes nearer and nearer to
look at the strange sight;—the hunter shoots and he dies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
There are many had spirits. The Wyandot who struck at my
white brother, he was a cunning snake; he had taken scalps,
the ball of his rifle did not wander; if he had crept in the
bushes on my brother’s path, Netis would now be in the happy
hunting&ndash;fields of the white warriors. But a bad spirit took
him; he offered food while his heart was false, and he thrust
his head under the tomahawk of War&ndash;Eagle. There are
many bad spirits.—I have spoken.”</p>

<p>Reginald listened with interest to these sentiments of his
Indian friend, expressed, as they were, in broken sentences
and in broken English, the purport of them being, however,
exactly conveyed in the foregoing sentences; but he refrained
from pursuing the subject further, observing that War&ndash;Eagle
was slinging the turkeys over Wingenund’s shoulder, and
preparing to pursue their course in search of the elk. Leaving
the youth to return with his feathered burden to the encampment,
the two friends continued their excursion, War&ndash;Eagle
leading the way, and stopping every now and then to examine
such tracks as appeared to him worthy of notice. They had
not proceeded far, when they reached a spot where the path
which they were following crossed a small rivulet, and, the
soil being soft on its bank, there were numerous hoof&ndash;prints
of deer and elk, but so confused by the trampling of the different
animals, that Reginald could not distinguish the one
from the other. It was not so, however, with the Indian;
for, pointing downward to a track at his foot, he made a sign,
by raising both his hands above his head, to indicate a pair of
antlers, and whispered to Reginald “very big.”</p>

<p>“An elk?” inquired the latter; making a silent affirmative
sign, War&ndash;Eagle pursued the trail which conducted them to
the top of a small rising ground, where it appeared to branch
in several directions, and became almost imperceptible from the
shortness of the grass and the hardness of the soil. But these
seemed to offer no impediment to the Indian’s pursuit of his
quarry, for turning short at a right angle to their former
course, he descended the hillock in a different direction, walking
with a swift noiseless step, as if he saw his game before
him.</p>

<p>Reginald’s surprise overcame even his eagerness for the
sport, trained as he had been in the woods, and justly held one
of the quickest and most skilful hunters in the territory. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
had looked in vain on the ground which they were now traversing
for the slightest point or footmark: touching, therefore,
his friend lightly on his shoulder, he whispered, “Does
my brother guess the elk’s path?—or can he smell it, like the
Spaniard’s dog?”</p>

<p>A good&ndash;humoured smile played on the Delaware’s lip as he
replied, “The trail of the elk is broad and easy; War&ndash;Eagle
could follow it by the moon’s light! My white brother will
see: he is an elk&ndash;chief; his squaws are with him.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he showed several marks, which Reginald could
scarcely distinguish, on the short grass: a few yards further
War&ndash;Eagle added, pointing to a low bush beside them, “If
Netis does not see the elk’s foot, he can see his teeth.”</p>

<p>On examining the bush, Reginald perceived that a small
fresh twig from the side of it had been recently cropped, and
suppressing his astonishment at his friend’s sagacity, in following
with such apparent ease a trail that to him was scarcely
discernible, he allowed him to proceed without further interruption,
closely watching his every movement, in the hope that
he might be able to discover some of the indications by which
the Indian was guided. Moving lightly forward, they soon
had occasion again to cross the brook before mentioned; and
on the soft edge of its banks War&ndash;Eagle pointed in silence to
the track of the large hoof of the elk, and to the smaller print
left by the feet of its female companions. Desiring Reginald
to remain still, the Indian now crept stealthily forward to the
top of a small hillock covered with brushwood, where he lay
for a few seconds with his ear touching the ground. Having
once raised his head to look through a low bush in front of
him, he sunk again upon the ground, and made a signal for
his friend to creep to the spot. Reginald obeyed, and peering
cautiously through the leaves of the same bush, he saw the
stately elk browsing at a distance of an hundred and fifty
yards, the two hinds being beyond him. The intervening
ground being barren and almost flat, offering no cover for a
nearer approach, his first impulse was to raise his rifle for a
distant shot; but War&ndash;Eagle, gently pressing down the barrel,
motioned him to crouch behind the bush. When they were
again concealed, the Delaware whispered to his friend, that
he would go round and creep on the elk from the opposite
quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Reginald, in reply, pointed to the top branches of a young
poplar gently waving in the breeze.</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle knows it,” said the Indian, gravely, “the
wind is from that quarter; it is not good; but he will try;
if elk smell him, he comes this way, and Netis shoot him.”
So saying, he crept down the little hillock by the same path
which they had followed in the ascent, and then striking off
in an oblique direction, was soon lost to view.</p>

<p>Reginald, still concealed behind the bush, silent and motionless,
with his hand on the lock of his rifle, watched intently
every movement of the antlered monarch of the woods: the
latter, unconscious of danger, lazily picked the tenderest
shoots from the surrounding bushes, or tossed his lofty head
to and fro, as if to display the ease and grace with which it
bore those enormous antlers. More than once, as he turned
to brush off from his side some troublesome fly, Reginald
thought he had become suddenly aware of the Indian’s
approach; but it was not so, for in spite of the disadvantage
of the wind, the practised Delaware moved towards his
unsuspecting prey with the stealthy creep of a panther.
Reginald’s impatience was such that minutes seemed to him
hours; and his fingers played with the lock of his rifle, as if
he could no longer control their movement: at length a
sudden snort from one of the hinds announced that she smelt
or heard some object of alarm as she came trotting to the side
of her lordly protector.</p>

<p>Turning himself to windward, and throwing forward his
ears, the elk listened for a moment, while his upturned and
wide distended nostril snuffed the breeze, to discover the danger
of which he had been warned by his mate. That moment
was not lost by the Delaware, and the report of his rifle
echoed through the forest. Tossing his head with a sudden
start, the elk fled from his now discovered foe, and came
bounding over the barren space in front of the bush where
Reginald was concealed. With a coolness that did great credit to
his nerves as a hunter, the latter remained motionless, with
his eye on the game and his finger on the trigger, until the
elk passed his station at full speed: then he fired, and with so
true an aim, that ere it had gone fifty yards, the noble beast
fell to the earth, and immediately Reginald’s hunting&ndash;knife
put an end to its pain and to its life. The young man looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
over the quarry with pride and pleasure, for it was the
largest he had ever seen; and the shot (which had pierced
the heart) was well calculated to raise War&ndash;Eagle’s opinion of
his skill in wood&ndash;craft. Whilst he was still contemplating the
animal’s bulk and fine proportions, the exclamation “good!”
uttered in English, gave him the first notice that the Delaware
was at his side.</p>

<p>“Ha! my friend,” said Reginald, grasping his hand cordially;
“you sent him down towards me in fine style. Tell
me War&ndash;Eagle, are there many elks as large in this country?”</p>

<p>“Not many,” replied the Indian; “War&ndash;Eagle told his
white brother that the elk’s foot on the trail was big.”</p>

<p>“Was my brother very far when he shot?” inquired
Reginald; “when his rifle speaks, the ball does not wander
in the air.”</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle was far,” replied the Indian, quietly, “but
the elk carries the mark of his rifle—Netis shot better.”
On examination, it appeared that the chief was right; his
bullet had passed through the fleshy part of the animal’s neck;
but not having cut the windpipe, the wound was not mortal,
and but little blood had flowed from it.</p>

<p>While the Indian was busied in skinning and cutting up
the elk, Reginald amused himself by reconnoitring the ground
over which his friend had crept before he shot, and he was
struck by the extraordinary sagacity with which the latter had
made his approach; for on that side there were but few and
scattered bushes, nor was there any rugged or broken ground
favourable for concealment.</p>

<p>When the choicest portions of meat were duly separated
and enveloped in the skin, War&ndash;Eagle hung them up on
an adjacent tree, carefully rubbing damp powder over the
covering, to protect the meat from the wolves and carrion
birds; after which the friends proceeded on their excursion.</p>

<p>Having found fresh tracks of elk leading towards the open
Prairie, they followed them, and succeeded in killing two more,
after which they returned to the encampment, whence War&ndash;Eagle
despatched a young Indian with a horse, and with
directions as to the locality of the meat, which he was
instructed to bring home.</p>

<p>As Reginald walked through the lodges of the Osage village,
he observed a crowd of Indians collected before one of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and curiosity prompted him to turn aside and observe what
might be passing. Making his way without difficulty through
the outer circle of spectators, he found himself before a lodge,
in front of which a wounded boy of twelve or fourteen years
of age was extended on a buffalo&ndash;robe. On inquiry, Reginald
learnt from an Indian who could speak a few words of English,
that the lad had been struck down and trampled on by a vicious
horse: although no sounds escaped from his lips, the involuntary
writhing of the youthful sufferer showed the acuteness of
the pain which he endured; while a bulky Indian, in the
garb of an Osage medicine&ndash;man, was displaying beside him
the various absurd mummeries of his vocation.</p>

<p>This native quack was naked to the waist; his breast and
back being painted over with representations of snakes and
lizards. Instead of the usual breech&ndash;cloth, or middle garment,
he wore a kind of apron of antelope skins, hemmed, or
skirted with feathers of various colours: the borders of his
leggings were also adorned with the wings of an owl; in one
hand he held a tomahawk, the haft of which was painted
white, and in the other a hollow gourd, containing a few hard
beans, or stones of the wild cherry, which latter instrument
he rattled incessantly round the head of his patient, accompanying
this Æsculapian music with the most grotesque gesticulations,
and a sort of moaning howl—all these being intended
to exorcise and drive away the evil spirit of pain.</p>

<p>While Reginald was contemplating the strange spectacle
with mingled curiosity and compassion he heard a confused
murmur among those Indians nearest to the corner of the
lodge, and thought he could distinguish the name of Olitipa:
nor was he mistaken, for almost immediately afterwards the
crowd divided, and Prairie&ndash;bird appeared before the lodge.
Her dress was the same as that which Reginald had before
seen, excepting that, in place of the chaplet of wild flowers,
she wore on her head a turban of party&ndash;coloured silk, the
picturesque effect of which blending with her dark hair and the
oriental character of her beauty, reminded our hero of those
Circassian enchantresses whom he had read of in eastern fable,
as ruling satrap or sultan with a power more despotic than
his own!</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird, walking gently forward with modest self&ndash;possession,
took her place by the side of the sufferer, as if unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the numerous eyes that were observing all her
movements: the medicine&ndash;man, whose exorcisms had been
hitherto attended with no success, retreated into the lodge,
whence he narrowly and silently observed the proceedings of
his fair rival in the healing art.</p>

<p>It was not difficult for Prairie&ndash;bird to ascertain that the
boy’s hurts were very serious; for the hot brow, the dry lip,
the involuntary contortions of the frame, gave clear evidence
of acute pain and fever. She deeply regretted that the missionary
had been absent when she was summoned, as his assistance
would have been most useful; nevertheless, she resolved
to do all in her power towards the mitigation of sufferings,
the cure of which seemed beyond the reach of her simple
remedies. Opening a bag that hung at her girdle, she drew
from it some linen bandage, and various salves and simples,
together with a small case of instruments belonging to Paul
Müller, and kneeling by her young patient’s side, she breathed a
short but earnest prayer for the blessing of Heaven on her humble
exertions. During this pause, the Indians observed a strict
and attentive silence; and Reginald felt a kind of awe mingle
itself with his impassioned admiration, as he contemplated the
unaffected simplicity and loveliness of her kneeling figure.</p>

<p>A serious wound in the young patient’s temple claimed her
first care, which having washed and closed, she covered with a
healing plaster; but observing that the symptoms of fever had
rather increased than diminished, she knew that the lancet
should be immediately applied, and cast her anxious eyes around
in the hope that the missionary might have heard of the accident,
and be now on his way to the lodge. While looking thus
around, she became for the first time aware of Reginald’s
presence; and a slight blush accompanied her recognition
of him; but her thoughts recurring immediately to the object
of her present attention, she asked him in a clear low voice to
come nearer, on which he moved forward from the circle of
spectators, and stood before the lodge.</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird, pointing to the form of the young Indian, said,
in English, “The poor boy is much hurt, he will die if he is
not bled; the Black Father is absent; can Reginald take blood
from the arm?”</p>

<p>“I do not pretend to much skill in surgery, fair Prairie&ndash;bird,”
replied the young man, smiling; “but I have learnt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
bleed my horse and my dog, and if the necessity be urgent,
methinks I can open a vein in this boy’s arm without much
risk of danger.”</p>

<p>“It is indeed urgent,” said the maiden, earnestly; “here
are Paul Müller’s instruments; I pray you take a lancet and
proceed without delay.”</p>

<p>Thus urged, Reginald selected a lancet, and having proved
its sharpness, he passed a bandage tightly round the sufferer’s
arm, and set about his first surgical operation with becoming
care and gravity, the Osages drawing near and looking on in
attentive silence. Before applying the lancet, he said in a low
voice to Prairie&ndash;bird, “Must I allow a considerable quantity
of blood to flow ere I stanch it?” and on her making an
affirmative sign, he added, “Let me entreat you to turn your
eyes away, it is not a fitting sight for them, and they might
affect the steadiness of my nerves.”</p>

<p>With a deep blush Prairie&ndash;bird cast down her eyes, and
began to employ them busily in searching her little bag for
some cordial drinks and healing ointment, to be administered
after the bleeding should be over.</p>

<p>Reginald acquitted himself of his task with skill and with
complete success, and found no difficulty in stanching the
blood, and placing a proper bandage on the arm; after which
the restoratives prepared by Prairie&ndash;bird were applied, and in a
very short time they had the satisfaction of finding the symptoms
of fever and pain subside, and were able to leave the
youthful patient to repose, Prairie&ndash;bird promising to visit him
again on the morrow.</p>

<p>An elderly brave of the Osages now stepped forward, and
presented Prairie&ndash;bird with a girdle of cloth, ornamented with
feathers, quills, and beads, of the gayest colours,—an offering
which she received with that modest grace which was inseparable
from her every movement; the same brave (who was,
in fact, the father of the wounded boy,) presented Reginald
with a painted buffalo robe, which, as soon as he had displayed
its strange designs and devices, he desired a young Indian to
convey to the white chief’s lodge. Our hero having, in return,
given to the Osage a knife with an ornamented sheath,
which he had worn, in addition to his own, in case of being
suddenly called upon to make such a present, prepared to
accompany Prairie&ndash;bird to her lodge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>As they left the circle, Reginald’s eye encountered that of
Mahéga, fixed with a scowling expression on himself and his
fair companion; but he passed on without noticing the sullen
and haughty chief, being resolved not to involve himself in
any quarrel in her presence. They walked slowly towards the
lodge of Tamenund, and it must be confessed that they did
not take exactly the shortest path to it, Reginald leading the
way, and Prairie&ndash;bird following his occasional deviations with
marvellous acquiescence.</p>

<p>The young man turned the conversation on the character of
Paul Müller, knowing it to be a subject agreeable to Prairie&ndash;bird,
and well calculated to give him an opportunity of listening
to that voice which was already music to his ear; nor was
he disappointed, for she spoke of him with all the warmth of
the most affectionate regard; and the expression of her feelings
imparted such eloquence to her tongue and to her beaming
eyes, that Reginald looked and listened in enraptured
silence. As they drew near her tent, she suddenly checked
herself, and looking up in his face with an archness that was
irresistible, said, “Pray pardon me, I have been talking all
this time, when I ought to have been listening to you, who
are so much wiser than myself.”</p>

<p>“Say not so,” replied Reginald, with an earnestness that he
attempted not to conceal: “say not so, I only regret that we
have already reached your tent, for I should never be weary of
listening to your voice.”</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird replied with that ingenuous simplicity peculiar
to her:</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you say so, for I know you speak the
truth, and it makes me very happy to give you pleasure. Now
I must go into my tent.”</p>

<p>So saying she held out her hand to him, and nothing but the
presence of several Indians loitering near prevented his obeying
the impulse which prompted him to press it to his lips.
Checking it by an effort of prudence, he withdrew into the
lodge of Tamenund, and mused on the qualities of this extraordinary
child of the wilderness,—her beauty, her grace, her
dignity, and, above all, that guileless simplicity that distinguished
her beyond all that he had ever seen; in short, he
mused so long on the subject that we will leave him to his
meditations, as we fear it must be confessed that he was almost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
if not quite, “in love;” and the reflections of parties so circumstanced,
are rarely interesting to others.</p>

<p>What were the feelings of Prairie&ndash;bird when she once more
found herself alone in her tent, and vainly endeavoured to still
the unwonted tumult in her heart? Her thoughts, in spite of
herself, would dwell on the companion who had escorted her
from the Osage lodge: his words still rung in her ears; his
image was before her eyes; she felt ashamed that one, almost a
stranger, should thus absorb all her faculties; and was the more
ashamed, from being conscious that she did not wish it were
otherwise; her heart told her that it would not exchange its
present state of tumult and subjection for its former condition
of quiet and peace!</p>

<p>Lest the reader should be inclined to judge her as harshly
as she judged herself, we will beg him to remember the circumstances
and history of this singular girl. Brought up
among a roving tribe of Indians, she had fortunately fallen into
the hands of a family remarkable for the highest virtues exhibited
by that people: the missionary, Paul Müller, had cultivated
her understanding with the most affectionate and zealous
care; and he was, with the exception of an occasional trader
visiting the tribe, almost the only man of her own race whom
she had seen; and though entertaining towards Tamenund the
gratitude which his kindness to her deserved, and towards War&ndash;Eagle
and Wingenund the affectionate regard of a sister, both
the knowledge imparted by the missionary, and her own instinctive
feeling, had taught her to consider herself among
them as a separate and isolated being. These feelings she had
of course nourished in secret, but they had not altogether
escaped the penetration of Wingenund, who, it may be remembered,
had told Reginald on their first meeting that the antelope
was as likely to pair with the elk, as was his sister to choose a
mate among the chiefs of the Osage or the Lenapé.</p>

<p>On the return of the two Delawares from their excursion to
the Muskingum, Wingenund had related to Prairie&ndash;bird the
heroic gallantry with which the young white chief had plunged
into the river to save War&ndash;Eagle’s life: he had painted, with
untutored but impassioned eloquence, the courage, the gentleness,
the generosity, of his new friend. Prairie&ndash;bird’s own
imagination had filled up the picture, and the unseen preserver
of her Indian brother was therein associated with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
highest qualities that adorned the heroes of such tales as she
had read or heard recounted by the missionary.</p>

<p>She had reached that age when the female heart, unsupported
by maternal protection, and severed from the ties of
kindred, naturally seeks for something on which to rest its
affection. Are we then to wonder if, when Reginald Brandon
first stood before her, when she saw in his noble form and expressive
features all her secret imaginations more than realised,
when he addressed her in her own tongue, and in a tone of
voice gentle even to tenderness; are we to wonder, or to blame,
this nursling of the wilderness, if the barriers of pride and
reserve gave way beneath the flood which swept over them
with fresh and irresistible force? Often had she, on various
pretexts, made Wingenund repeat to her the adventures and
occurrences of his excursion to the Ohio; and as the artless
boy described, in language as clear as his memory was tenacious,
the dwelling of Reginald’s father, the range of buildings,
the strange furniture, the garden, the winding brook that
bounded its enclosure, and above all the fair features and winning
gentleness of the Lily of Mooshanne, Prairie&ndash;bird would cover
her averted face with her hands, as if struggling to banish or to
recall some wild delusive dream, and her lips would move in
unconscious repetition of “Mooshanne.” Surprised at her agitation,
Wingenund had once so far laid aside the strictness of
Indian reserve as to inquire into its cause; and she replied,
with a melancholy smile,</p>

<p>“Wingenund has painted the Lily of Mooshanne in colours
so soft and sweet, that Olitipa longs to embrace and love her
as a sister.”</p>

<p>The boy fixed his penetrating eye upon her countenance, in
deep expressive silence, the innate delicacy of his feeling triumphed,
and Prairie&ndash;bird’s secret meditations were thenceforward
undisturbed.</p>

<p>To return from this retrospective digression. Prairie&ndash;bird’s
tent was divided, by a partition of buffalo skins, into two compartments,
in the outer of which was her guitar, the books lent
her by the missionary, a small table and two chairs, or rather
stools, the latter rudely but efficiently constructed by his own
hands; in the corner also stood the chest, where his medicines,
instruments, and other few valuables were deposited; in the
inner compartment was a bed, composed of Mexican grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
stretched upon four wooden feet, and covered with dressed antelope
skins and blankets of the finest quality. Here also was
a chest, containing her quaint but not ungraceful apparel, and
the other requisites for her simple toilet; at night a female
slave, a captive taken from one of the southern tribes, slept
in the outer compartment, and the ever watchful Wingenund
stretched himself on a buffalo robe across the aperture, so that
the slumbers of the fair Prairie&ndash;bird were securely guarded
even during the absence of Paul Müller; and when he was
with the tribe, his small tent was separated from hers only by
a partition of skins, which in case of alarm might be cut open
by a sharp knife in a moment. There was, in truth, little
fear for the security of this extraordinary girl, who was looked
upon, as we have before observed, by all the tribe with mingled
awe and affection.</p>

<p>In the outer room of the two compartments above mentioned
she was now sitting, with her eyes cast upon the ground, and
her fingers straying unconsciously over the strings of her guitar,
when she was aroused from her long reverie by the soft voice
of the female slave who had entered unperceived, and who now
said, in the Delaware tongue,</p>

<p>“Are Olitipa’s ears shut, and is the voice of Wingenund
strange to them?”</p>

<p>“Is my brother there,” replied the maiden, ashamed at her
fit of absence; “tell him, Lita, that he is welcome.”</p>

<p>The girl addressed by the name of Lita was about seventeen
years of age, small, and delicately formed, exceedingly dark,
her wild and changeful countenance being rather of a gipsy
than of an Indian character. She had been taken, when a
child, by a war&ndash;party which had penetrated into the country
of the Comanches, a powerful and warlike tribe still inhabiting
the extensive prairies on the Mexican and Texian frontier.
She was devotedly attached to Prairie&ndash;bird, who treated her
more like a friend than a slave, but towards all others she
observed an habitual and somewhat haughty silence. Had her
fate condemned her to any other lodge in the encampment, the
poor girl’s life would have been a continued succession of
blows, labour, and suffering; for her spirit was indomitable,
and impracticable to every other control than kindness; but as
the good&ndash;humoured Tamenund had appropriated her services to
his favourite child, she passed most of her time in Olitipa’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
tent, and thus avoided the ill&ndash;usage to which she might otherwise
have been exposed.</p>

<p>Such was the girl who now went to the folding aperture of
the tent, and desired Wingenund to come in. The youth
entered, followed by a boy bearing a large covered dish or
basket of wicker&ndash;work, which having placed on the table, he
withdrew. Prairie&ndash;bird could not fail to observe in her young
brother’s countenance and carriage an unusual stateliness and
dignity, and she remarked at the same time the circumstance
of his having brought with him the boy to carry her basket, a
service which he had been accustomed to perform with his
own hands. Making him a sign to sit down, she thus accosted
him, in terms allusive to the customs of the tribe:—</p>

<p>“Has my young brother dreamt? Has the breath of the
Great Spirit passed over his sleep?”</p>

<p>“It is so,” replied Wingenund. “The chiefs and the
braves have sat at the council&ndash;fire; the name of Wingenund
was on their tongues, the deeds of his fathers are not forgotten;
he is not to do the work of squaws; his name will be heard
among the warriors of the Lenapé.”</p>

<p>From this reply Prairie&ndash;bird knew that her young brother
was about to undergo the fasting, and other superstitious
ordeals, through which those youths were made to pass who
wished to be enrolled among the warriors of the tribe at an
earlier age than usual. These superstitious observances were
repugnant to her good sense and enlightened understanding;
and as she had hitherto acted in the capacity of monitress and
instructress, she was perhaps not pleased at the prospect of his
suddenly breaking loose from her gentle dominion: she said
to him, therefore, in a tone more grave than usual,—</p>

<p>“Wingenund has heard the Black Father speak;—were his
ears shut? Does he not know that there is one God above,
who rules the world alone? The totems<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, and the symbols and
the dreams of the medicine&ndash;men, are for those poor Indians
whose minds are under a cloud. Wingenund cannot believe
these things!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“My sister speaks wisely,” replied the youth; “the wind
cannot blow away her words: but Wingenund is of the Lenapé,
the ancient people; he wishes to live and die among their braves;
he must travel in the path that his fathers have trod, or the
warriors will not call his name when the hatchet is dug up.”</p>

<p>“Let not the hatchet be dug up,” said the maiden, anxiously.
“Have I not told my brother that God is the avenger of
blood spilt by man? why should his foot be set on the war&ndash;path?”</p>

<p>“While the hatchet is below the earth,” replied the
youth, in the low, musical accent of his tribe, “Wingenund
will sit by his sister and listen to her wisdom; he will go out
with War&ndash;Eagle and bring back the skin of the antelope or
the doe for her apparel, the meat of the deer and the bison for
her food; he will open his ears to the counsel of the Black
Father, and will throw a thick blanket over thoughts of strife
and blood. But if the Washashee (the Osage) bears a
forked tongue (here the youth sank his voice to a whisper of
deep meaning),—if he loosens the scalp&ndash;knife while his hand
is on the poacan<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>—if the trail of the Dahcotah is found near
our village, Wingenund must be awake: he is not a child:
the young men will hear his voice, and the old men shall say,
‘He is the son of his father.’ It is enough. Let my sister
eat the meat that War&ndash;Eagle has sent her: for three suns
Wingenund tastes not food.”</p>

<p>So saying, the lad threw his robe over his shoulder and left
the tent. Prairie&ndash;bird gazed long and thoughtfully on the
spot where her brother’s retreating figure had disappeared; she
felt grieved that all the lessons and truths of Christianity
which she had endeavoured to instil into his mind were unable
to change the current of his Indian blood: she had hoped to
see him become a civilised man and a convert, and, through his
amiable character, and the weight of his name, to win over
many others of the Lenapé tribe. In addition to this disappointment,
she was alarmed at the purport of his parting
words: he had hinted at some treachery on the part of
their Osage allies, and that a trail of the Dahcotahs had been
seen near the encampment. These subjects of anxiety, added
to the excitement which her feelings had lately undergone, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
completely engrossed the maiden’s attention, that, although the
corn&ndash;cakes were of the sweetest kind, and the venison of the
most delicate flavour, the basket of provisions remained untouched
on the table when Paul Müller entered the tent.</p>

<p>His brow was grave and thoughtful, but his countenance
relaxed into its usual benevolent expression, as his affectionate
pupil sprang forward to greet and welcome him.</p>

<p>“Dear father, I am so glad you are come!” she exclaimed;
“I have been waiting for you most impatiently, and I have
been in need of your aid.”</p>

<p>“I heard, my child, as I walked through the village, that
you had been tending the wounds of a boy much hurt by a
horse; was the hurt beyond your skill?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” she replied, hesitating. “It was needful
that blood should flow from his arm; and, as you were not
there, I was forced to ask the assistance of Netis—that is, of
Reginald.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the missionary, smiling, “I hope he proved
a skilful leech?”</p>

<p>“He would not allow me to look on,” she replied: “but,
though it was his first trial, he drew the blood, and stanched
it, as skilfully as you could have done it yourself; and then he
walked with me to the tent.”</p>

<p>“And you conversed much by the way?” inquired the
missionary.</p>

<p>“Oh yes; and he made me tell him a great deal about
you, and I was ashamed of talking so much; but then he told
me that it gave him pleasure to hear me talk. How can it
please him to hear me talk, dear father? I know nothing,
and he has seen and read so much.”</p>

<p>Paul Müller averted his face for a moment to conceal from
her the smile which he could scarcely repress, as he replied,</p>

<p>“My child, he has perhaps seen and read much; but the
life and habits of the Indians are new to him, and of these you
can tell him many things that he does not know.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, dear father,” she said, after a short silence, “are
there others like him in my country? I mean, not exactly
like him, but more like him than the traders whom I have
seen; they are so rough, and they drink fire&ndash;water, and they
never think of God or his mercies: but he is so noble, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
countenance made me afraid at first, but now, when he speaks
to me, his voice is as gentle as the fawn calling to its dam!”</p>

<p>Paul Müller saw very well how it fared with the heart of
Prairie&ndash;bird. He remembered that Reginald was the son of a
wealthy proprietor, who would probably have insuperable objections
to his son’s marrying a foundling of the wilderness,
and he hesitated whether he should not give her some warning
caution on a subject which he foresaw would so soon affect her
peace of mind. On the other hand, he was convinced that
Reginald was a man of generous and decided character, and,
while he resolved carefully to observe the intercourse between
them, he would not mar the unsuspecting purity of her nature,
nor throw any obstacle in the way of an attachment which he
believed might lead to the happiness of both parties. In
coming to this conclusion, it must not be forgotten that he
was a Moravian missionary, long resident in the Far&ndash;west, and
therefore not likely to trouble his head with the nice distinctions
of European aristocracy. In the country which was
now his home, he might be justified in deeming a match
equal, if the man were honest and brave, and the bride young
and virtuous, without reference to their birth, connections, or
worldly possessions. Under the impression of considerations
like these, the missionary replied to the maiden’s inquiry:</p>

<p>“My child, I will not say that among the cities and settlements
of the white men, there are many who would gain by
comparison with Reginald Brandon; for not only has he the
accidental advantages of fine features, and a form singularly
graceful and athletic, but he seems to me to possess the far
higher and rarer qualities of a modest, generous mind, and an
honest heart: nevertheless, my child, I will pray you, even in
respect to him, not to forget what I have told you regarding the
general infirmity and waywardness of our nature; keep a watch
on your eyes and on your heart, and Providence will rule all
for the best:—we will speak no more on this subject now; let
us take some food from the basket on your table.” Prairie&ndash;bird
spread the simple meal in thoughtful silence, and when
the missionary had asked a blessing on it, they sat down together.
After a pause of some minutes she communicated to
him her anxiety on account of the hints dropped by Wingenund
respecting the suspected treachery of some of their
Osage allies, and the circumstance of a hostile trail having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
been discovered near the encampment. “It is too true,” replied
the missionary gravely, “there are signs of approaching strife;
and even that boy, whom I have so long endeavoured to instruct
and lead aright, his blood is beginning to boil. I fear
it is almost as hard for an Indian to change his nature as an
Ethiopian his skin. He has told you the truth, and we must
be prepared for approaching trouble.”</p>

<p>After musing for a few moments, Paul Müller, fixing his
eye on Prairie&ndash;bird, continued: “Do you know any cause of
quarrel between the Osage and Lenapé chiefs?”</p>

<p>“None,” replied the maiden in unaffected surprise. “How
should I know? I go not near their council&ndash;fire.”</p>

<p>“True,” said the missionary; “but your eyes are not often
shut in broad day. Have you spoken to Mahéga of late? have
you observed him?”</p>

<p>“He has spoken to me more than once, and often meets me
on my return from any far lodge in the village. I do not
like him; he is fierce and bad, and he beats his young squaw,
Wetopa.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my child; avoid him; there is evil in that
man; but if you meet him, do not show any dislike or suspicion
of him; you would only kindle strife: you are among
faithful and watchful friends; and if they were all to slumber
and sleep, you have a Friend above, whose eye is never closed,
and whose faithfulness is everlasting. Farewell, my child.
I must converse awhile with Tamenund. Do you solace an
hour with your guitar; it will put your unquiet thoughts to
rest.”</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird was so accustomed to pay implicit obedience to
the slightest wishes and suggestions of her beloved preceptor,
that as he left the tent she mechanically took up the guitar,
and passed her fingers through the strings. By degrees the
soul of music within her was stirred, and ere long vented itself
in the following hymn.</p>

<p>The words were in the Delaware tongue, and composed by
herself—the melodies (for more than one were introduced into
the irregular chaunt) were such as she had caught or mingled
from Indian minstrelsy, and the whole owed its only attraction
to the sweet and varied tones of her voice. The first measure
was a low recitative, which might be thus rendered in English:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“The sun sinks behind the western hills;<br />
Deep red are the curtains of his couch.<br />
One by one the stars appear;<br />
Many they are and lustrous.<br />
The pale moon is among them!<br />
They walk in their appointed path,<br />
Singing on their way, ‘God made us all!’</p>
<p class="pph12"><i>Machelenda sutch Ktelewunsoacan</i>,</p>
<p class="pph18">or</p>
<p class="pph12">Hallowed be thy name.”</p>

<p class="p1">Here the measure changed, and sweeping the strings with a
bolder hand, she continued her untutored hymn, blending her
Christian creed with the figures and expressions of the people
among whom she dwelt.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“The Great Spirit of the Lenapé is God.<br />
He has sent His word to gladden the heart of man.<br />
But clouds still darken the minds of the ancient people.<br />
The Great Spirit knows that they are blind and deaf,<br />
Yet His ear is open to hear,<br />
His hand is ready to guide.</p>
<p class="pph16">(<i>ut suprà.</i>)</p>
<p class="pph12">Hallowed be thy name!”</p>

<p class="p1">Again the measure changed, as in the richest tones of her
melodious voice she pursued her theme.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Sion and the everlasting mountains are thy footstool!<br />
Lightnings are about thy throne.<br />
Thunder is thy voice.<br />
And the evil spirit trembles before thee!<br />
The eagle cannot soar to thy habitation;<br />
His eye cannot look on thy brightness;<br />
Yet dost thou give life to the insect,<br />
And breath to the merry wren!<br />
Thou leadest the wild horse to the pasture,<br />
And the thirsty fawn to the stream.</p>
<p class="pph12">Hallowed be thy name.”</p>

<p class="p1">Here the measure resumed its low and plaintive melody, as
she thus concluded her song.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Who sings the praise of God?<br />
It is ‘Prairie&ndash;bird,’ the poor child of the wilderness.<br />
But God spurns not her prayer;<br />
She is a stray&ndash;leaf, that knows not the tree<br />
Whence the rude wind hath blown it;<br />
But God planted the parent stem.<br />
And not a branch or leaf thereof is hid from His sight.<br />
The young whip&ndash;poor&ndash;will flies to its mother’s nest,<br />
The calf bleats to the bison&ndash;cow:<br />
No mother’s voice says to Olitipa,’Come here!’<br />
The wide prairie is her home!<br />
God is a Father to Olitipa!</p>
<p class="pph12">Hallowed be thy name!”</p>

<p class="p1">In singing the last few words, the tones of her voice were
“most musical, most melancholy;” and though no human eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
marked the teardrop that stole down her cheek, it would appear
that her song had excited sympathy in some human
bosom, for a deep sigh fell upon her ear: startled at the
sound, Prairie&ndash;bird looked around her tent, but no one could
be seen; she listened, but it was not repeated, and the maiden
remained unconscious that at the very first touch of her guitar
Reginald had crept out of the adjoining lodge, and, enveloped
in a buffalo robe on the grass at the back of her tent, had
heard from beginning to end her plaintive hymn, and had paid
the unconscious tribute of a heavy sigh to the touching pathos
of its closing strain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">SYMPTOMS OF A RUPTURE BETWEEN THE DELAWARES AND OSAGES.—MAHÉGA
COMES FORWARD IN THE CHARACTER OF A LOVER.—HIS
COURTSHIP RECEIVES AN UNEXPECTED INTERRUPTION.</p>

<p class="pn">Paul Müller, having left the lodge of Prairie&ndash;bird, fulfilled
his intention of entering that of Tamenund: he found the
venerable chieftain seated upon a buffalo robe; his back
leaned against a bale of cloth, a highly ornamented pipe&ndash;stem
at his lips, while from its other extremity a thin column of
smoke, rising in wavy folds, found its way out of the accidental
rents and crevices in the skins which covered the lodge. War&ndash;Eagle
was listening in an attitude of respectful attention to the
words which fell from his father; but the subject of conversation
was evidently of some importance, as the women and the
youths were whispering together at a distance from the two
principal persons. The entrance of the missionary was not
unnoticed, for Tamenund made him a signal to draw near and
sit down; several times the pipe was passed round in silence,
when the old chief addressing his guest in the Delaware
tongue, said, “The Black Father knows that there are dark
clouds in the sky!”</p>

<p>“He does,” replied the missionary. A glance of intelligence
passed between War&ndash;Eagle and Tamenund, as the latter
proceeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“What says the Black Father? Is the storm to break, or
will the sun shine again?”</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit only knows,” replied the missionary;
“if the sun shines, we will be thankful; if the storm falls, we
will wrap round us the cloak of patience.”</p>

<p>A fierce gleam shot from the young chief’s eye, but he spoke
not a word until Tamenund addressed him thus:—“What
says War&ndash;Eagle? let him speak.”</p>

<p>“The snows of many winters are on my father’s forehead;
the Black Father has learnt wisdom from the Great Spirit: it
is more fitting for War&ndash;Eagle to listen than to speak,” replied
the young man, curbing the angry thoughts that glowed in his
breast.</p>

<p>“Nay, my son,” said the missionary, “let War&ndash;Eagle
speak, and his saying be afterwards weighed by the aged
heads.”</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle then proceeded to explain how Wingenund, in
returning from the turkey&ndash;pen, had caught a glimpse of a distant
figure, whom he knew at a glance to belong to another tribe.
Hastily concealing himself among the bushes, he waited till
the strange Indian passed, and then resolving to watch him,
crept stealthily on his trail.</p>

<p>Having made his way to a hollow in the thickest part of
the forest, he sat down on the stump of an alder&ndash;tree, where
he made and twice repeated a low signal whistle, which was
soon answered by another Indian, who approached in an opposite
direction, and in whom, to his great surprise, Wingenund
recognised Mahéga. He was not near enough to overhear
their conversation, neither was he aware whether they spoke in
the Delaware tongue; but after conversing in a low tone for
some minutes, they separated, and Wingenund again put himself
on the trail of the stranger; the latter frequently stopped
in his course, looked round and listened, but the youth was too
practised and sagacious to be baffled by these precautions, and
finally succeeded in tracking the object of his pursuit to an
encampment containing ten or a dozen armed Indians, whom
he knew at once to form a war&ndash;party, but could not decide to
what tribe they belonged; he succeeded, however, in securing
a mocassin which one of them had dropped, and returned unperceived
to the Delaware village.</p>

<p>Such was the outline of the occurrences now rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
sketched by War&ndash;Eagle; and in concluding his narrative, he
held up the mocassin above mentioned, and presented it to the
aged chief. The latter examined it for a moment in silence,
and restoring it to the warrior, pronounced, in a low guttural
tone, the word “Dahcotah.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the War&ndash;Eagle, in a deep whisper, indicative
of the indignant passion that boiled within; “yes, the Dahcotah
is in the woods; he prowls like a prairie&ndash;wolf. The
Great Spirit has made him a dog, and if he sets his foot on the
hunting&ndash;ground of the Lenapé, let not his wife complain if she
looks along his path in vain, and strikes her breast, saying,
‘The wife of the Dahcotah is a widow!’ But the Evil Spirit
has crept into the heart of the Washashee, a snake is in the
council&ndash;chamber of the Lenapé, and lies are on the tongue of
Mahéga! Is it enough, or must War&ndash;Eagle speak more?”</p>

<p>“The words of my son are hard,” replied Tamenund,
shaking his head sorrowfully; “the Dahcotah are dogs, they
are on a deer&ndash;hunt; their heart is not big enough to make
them dig up the hatchet to fight with the Lenapé. Tamenund
cannot believe that the tongue of Mahéga is so forked, or his
heart so black, that two suns have not passed since he sat and
smoked in this lodge, and spoke of Olitipa, the daughter of the
Prairie. He said that her voice was music to him, that her
form was in his dreams, and he asked Tamenund to give her
to him as a wife.”</p>

<p>At these words the suppressed rage of the youthful warrior
had well&ndash;nigh burst the iron bands of Indian self&ndash;control; he
ground his teeth audibly together, his dilated form trembled
through every nerve and muscle; but observing the keen eye
of the missionary fixed upon his countenance, he subdued in a
moment the rising tempest, and asked, in a voice the forced
calmness of which was fearful, “What said my father?”</p>

<p>Tamenund replied that the maiden was Great Medicine in
the tribe, that she was a gift of the Great Spirit, and that her
dwelling could never be in the lodge of an Osage chief. “He
went away without speaking,” added the old man seriously;
“but his eye spoke bad words enough!”</p>

<p>“My father said well,” exclaimed the impetuous young
man; “let Mahéga seek a wife among his dog&ndash;brothers the
Dahcotahs! War&ndash;Eagle will smoke no more in his lodge.”</p>

<p>After a brief pause, Tamenund continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“My son has told half his thoughts, let him speak on.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” returned the young warrior, “let my father consult
the Medicine, and the counsellors who have seen many winters:
War&ndash;Eagle will whisper to his braves, and when the
ancient men in council have spoken, he will be ready.”</p>

<p>With this ambiguous answer, he folded his buffalo robe over
his shoulder and left the lodge.</p>

<p>The missionary saw that mischief was brewing, yet knew
not how to prevent it. He had gained extraordinary influence
among the Delawares by never interfering in their councils,
unless when he felt assured that the result would justify the
advice which he offered; but on the present occasion it was
evident that his Indian friends had sufficient grounds for suspecting
their Osage allies of treachery; he resolved, therefore,
to wait and observe, before making those attempts at
reconciliation which became his character and his mission.
Influenced by this determination, he spoke a few words to the
aged chief on indifferent matters, and shortly afterwards retired
to his own lodge.</p>

<p>During the preceding conversation Baptiste had been seated
at a little distance, his whole attention apparently engaged
in mending a rent in his mocassins, but scarcely a word had
escaped his watchful ear; and while he heard with secret delight
that there was every chance of a fight with the Sioux,
towards whom he cherished, as we have before observed, an
unextinguished hatred, he could not view without much uneasiness
the dangerous position in which Reginald’s party
might be placed by a rupture between the Delawares and
Osages, in a wild region where either party might so soon
obtain the ready aid of the Pawnees, or some other warlike
and marauding tribe; he resolved, however, for the present to
content himself with putting his young leader on his guard,
reserving a fuller explanation until he should have been able to
ascertain the intentions of his Delaware friends: in this last
endeavour he did not anticipate much difficulty, for the experienced
woodsman had proved his steadiness to them in
many a fray, and his courage and skill were no less proverbial
among them than was his mortal enmity to the Dahcotahs.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred during the ensuing night to disturb the
quiet of the encampment, if that may be denominated quiet
which was constantly interrupted by the chattering of wakeful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
squaws, the barking of dogs, the occasional chaunt of a warrior,
and the distant howling of hungry wolves. Our hero’s
dreams were, like his waking thoughts, full only of Prairie&ndash;bird;
and when he rose at daybreak he expressed no wish to
roam or hunt, but lingered within view of that small circular
lodge, which contained the treasure that he valued most on
earth. To the cautious warning of Baptiste he answered,
smiling, “You confess yourself that you only suspect; you
know our friends and their language, their wiles, and their
stratagems. I trust the safety of my party to your sagacity;
if your suspicions are turned into certainty, tell me, and I am
ready to act.”</p>

<p>As the young man left the lodge without even taking his
cutlass or his rifle, Baptiste, looking after him, shrugged his
shoulders, adding in an under tone, just loud enough to be
heard by Monsieur Perrot, who sat at his side,—</p>

<p>“‘Suspicion,’ ‘certainty,’ ‘sagacity,’—why surely he is
mad! He talks as if plots and plans were measured out by
rule amongst the red&ndash;skins, as they may be ‘mongst lords and
princes in Europe! This comes of his towering, as they call
it, amongst the Dutch, and other outlandish tribes. Surely,
he’s lived enough in the territory to know that with these
Ingians, and special near a Sioux trail, the first suspicion a
man is like to get is an arrow in his ribs or a tomahawk in
his brain. Capote&ndash;bleu, Maître Perrot, what do you think of
your master, is he mad?”</p>

<p>“Very much mad,” said the good&ndash;humoured valet, grinning,
whilst he continued assiduously to pound some coffee&ndash;beans
which he was preparing for breakfast; “very much mad,
Monsieur Baptiste; he very mad to leave Paris to go to his
fox&ndash;huntin’ oncle in England; he more mad to leave dat for
the backwoods by de Muskingum; but he dam mad to leave
Mooshanne to come here where dere is nothing but naked
savages and naked prairies.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Maître Perrot,” replied the guide, “my father was
a Canada Frenchman, and although he was, mayhap, never
further east than Montreal, he was as fond of talking of Paris
as a bear is of climbing a bee&ndash;tree!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>“He very right, Monsieur Ba’tiste; de world without
Paris is no more dan a woman widout a tongue; but as you
know our language, I will speak it to you, for pronouncing
English is no better dan breaking stones wid your teeth!”
And the merry valet forthwith inflicted upon his graver companion
a Parisian tirade, that very soon went beyond the
latter’s stock of Canadian French.</p>

<p>The morning dawned with unusual splendour; the sun
gradually rose over the wooded hills that bounded the eastern
horizon, and the light breeze shook the dew&ndash;drops from the
flowers, as Prairie&ndash;bird, fresh and lovely as the scene around
her, tripped lightly over the grass to the sequestered spot
which we have before mentioned as being her favourite resort:
there, seated at the root of the aged tree where Reginald had
first seen her, she opened the volume which was her constant
companion, and poured forth the grateful feelings of her heart,
in the words of the inspired Prophet&ndash;King; at her feet flowed
the brawling stream which fed the valley below the encampment;
the merry birds sang their matins among the leafy
branches above her head, and around her sprang sweet&ndash;scented
flowers and blossoms of a thousand varied hues. There are
some spots, and some brief seasons, on earth, so redolent of
freshness, beauty, and repose, as almost to revive the Paradise
lost by our first parents; but soon, too soon, the effects of
primeval sin and its punishment are felt, and the atmosphere
of heavenly peace is tainted by the miasma of human passion!</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird had enjoyed for some time her study and her
meditations undisturbed, when her attention was caught by the
sound of approaching footsteps: the conscious blood rushed to
her cheek as she expected to see the same visitor who had so
suddenly presented himself on the preceding day, when, to her
surprise and annoyance, the gigantic figure of Mahéga stood before
her, on the opposite side of the streamlet by which she was
seated: although simple, unsuspecting, and fearless by nature,
there was something in the countenance and bearing of this
formidable chief that had always inspired her with mingled
dislike and awe: remembering on the present occasion the
hint lately given to her by the missionary, she returned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
haughty greeting of the Indian by a gentle inclination of her
head, and then summoned composure enough to continue her
reading, as if desirous to avoid conversation: such, however,
was not Mahéga’s intention, who, softening, as far he was able,
the rough tones of his voice, addressed to her, in the Delaware
tongue, a string of the finest Indian compliments on her
beauty and attractions. To these the maiden coldly replied
by telling him, that she thanked him for his good words, but
that as she was studying the commands of the Great Spirit,
she wished not to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Mahéga, nothing checked by this reply, continued to ply
her with protestations and promises, and concluded by telling
her that she <i>must</i> be his wife; that he was a warrior, and
would fill her wigwam with spoils and trophies. As he proceeded,
his countenance became more excited, and the tones of
his voice had already more of threat than of entreaty. Prairie&ndash;bird
replied, with forced calmness, that she knew he was a
great warrior, but that she could not be his wife: their paths
were different; his led to war, and spoils, and power in ruling
his tribe; hers to tending the sick and fulfilling the commands
of the Great Spirit given in the Medicine Book.
Irritated by the firm though gentle tone of her reply, the
violent passion of the chief broke out in a torrent of harsh
and menacing words: he called her a foundling and a slave;
adding, that in spite of the Delaware squaws and their white
allies, she should sleep in his lodge, although the honour was
greater than she deserved.</p>

<p>Fired with indignation at this brutal menace, the spirited
girl rose from her seat, and, looking him full in the face, replied,
“Prairie&ndash;bird is a foundling; if Mahéga knows his
parents, he disgraces their name; she would rather be the
slave of Tamenund than the wife of Mahéga.”</p>

<p>A demoniac grin stole over the features of the savage, as
he replied: “The words of Olitipa are bitter. Mahéga
laughs at her anger; she is alone and unprotected; will she
walk to his lodge, or must the warrior carry her?”</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill218" id="ill218">ill218</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc"><span class="smcap">Prairie&ndash;bird and Mahéga</span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, he advanced to the very edge of the narrow
stream! The maiden, although alarmed, retained sufficient
presence of mind to know that to save herself by flight was
impossible; but the courage of insulted virtue supported her,
and she answered him in a tone that breathed more of indignation
than of fear:</p>

<p>“Olitipa is not alone—is not unprotected! The Great
Spirit is her protector, before whom the stature of Mahéga is
as a blade of grass, and his strength like that of an infant.
See,” she continued, drawing from her girdle a small, sharp&ndash;pointed
dagger, “Olitipa is not unprotected: if Mahéga moves
a foot to cross that stream, this knife shall reach her heart;
and the great Mahéga will go to the hunting&ndash;fields of the
dead, a coward, and a woman&ndash;slayer.”</p>

<p>As she spoke these words she held the dagger pointed to
her bosom, now heaving with high emotion; her form seemed
to dilate, and her dark eye kindled with a prouder lustre.
The glow on her cheek, and the lofty dignity of her attitude,
only heightened her beauty in the eyes of the savage, and
confirmed him in carrying out his fell purpose, to ensure the
success of which he saw that stratagem, not force, must be
employed: assuming, therefore, a sarcastic tone of voice, he
replied,—</p>

<p>“Olitipa trusts to the edge of her knife; Mahéga laughs
at her.” Then he continued, in a louder key, as if addressing
an Indian behind her, “Let Wânemi seize her arm and
hold it.”</p>

<p>As the surprised maiden turned her head in the direction
where she expected to see the Indian to whom Mahéga was
speaking, that crafty chief cleared the brook at a bound, and
seizing her waist, while a smile of triumph lit up his features,
said, “The pretty one is Mahéga’s prisoner; there is no one
here but himself; a cunning tale tickled the ears of Olitipa.”</p>

<p>The hapless girl saw how she had been outwitted by the
savage: she struggled in vain to free herself from his grasp,
and a faint scream of despair broke from her lips.</p>

<p>The spring of a famished tiger on a heifer is not more
fiercely impetuous than was the bound with which Reginald
Brandon rushed from the adjacent thicket upon Mahéga,—reckless
of his opponent’s huge bulk and strength, forgetful
that he was himself unarmed. The cry of Prairie&ndash;bird had
strung with tenfold power every sinew in his athletic frame:
seizing with both hands the throat of Mahéga, he grasped it
with such deadly force that the Indian was compelled to release
his hold of the maiden,—but he still retained her knife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and in the struggle plunged it into the arm and shoulder of
Reginald, who relaxed not, however, his iron grasp, but still
bore his opponent backwards, until the foot of the latter
tripped over a projecting root, and he fell with tremendous
force upon his head, the blood gushing in torrents from his
nose and mouth. Reginald, who had been dragged down in
his fall, seized the dagger, and, as he raised it above his head,
felt a light touch upon his arm, and turning round saw Prairie&ndash;bird
kneeling at his side, her face pale as monumental marble,
and the sacred volume still clasped in her hand.</p>

<p>“Kill him not, Reginald,” she said, in a low impressive
voice; “‘Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord!’”</p>

<p>Breathless, and flushed with the late severe struggle, the
young man replied: “I will spare the villain, dear Prairie&ndash;bird,
at your bidding: he is stunned and senseless now, but
he will soon recover, and his fury and thirst for revenge will
know no bounds; he shall know, however, that I <i>have</i> spared
him.” So saying, he cut off the dyed and ornamented scalp&ndash;lock
from the top of Mahéga’s head, and, laying it beside the
prostrate chieftain, arose, and retired with Prairie&ndash;bird from
the spot.</p>

<p>They walked together some distance in silence, for her
heart was overcharged with contending emotions; and as they
went she unconsciously clung to his arm for support: at
length she stopped, and looking up in his face, her eyes glistening
with tears, she said,</p>

<p>“How am I ever to thank you?—my first debt of gratitude
is due to Heaven; but you have been its brave, its
blessed instrument of my deliverance from worse than death!”
and a shudder passed over her frame as the rude grasp of
Mahéga recurred to her remembrance.</p>

<p>“Dear Prairie&ndash;bird,” he replied; “as a man I would have
done as much for the poorest and most indifferent of your
sex—how then am I repaid a thousand, thousand fold by
having been allowed to serve a being so precious!” The deep
mellow tone in which he spoke these words, and the look by
which they were accompanied, brought the truant colour again
to the cheek of his companion, and as she cast her full dark
eyes downwards, they rested on the arm that supported her,
and she saw that his sleeve was stained and dropping with
blood!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! you are wounded, badly hurt, I fear. Tell me, tell
me, Reginald,” she continued, with an intensity of anxiety
that her expressive countenance betrayed, “are you badly
hurt?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, dear Prairie&ndash;bird, I cannot tell you: I felt the
Indian strike me twice with the dagger before he fell; I do
not think the wounds are serious, for you see I can walk and
assist your steps too.”</p>

<p>While he thus spoke he was, however, growing faint from
loss of blood, and the wound in his shoulder, having become
cold and stiff, gave him exquisite pain. Prairie&ndash;bird was not
deceived by the cheerfulness of his manner; she saw the paleness
that was gradually stealing over his countenance, and, with
ready presence of mind, insisted on his sitting down on the
trunk of a fallen tree beside their path. The suffering condition
of Reginald redoubled instead of paralysing her energies;
she filled his cap with fresh water from the brook, urged him
to taste a few drops, and sprinkled more over his face and
temples; then ripping up the sleeve of his hunting&ndash;shirt, she
found the blood still welling from two severe wounds between
the elbow and shoulder in the left arm: these she bathed and
carefully closed, applying to them a healing salve, which she
drew from the small bag that she wore at her girdle, after
which she bandaged the arm firmly with her kerchief; then,
kneeling beside him, strove to read in his face the success of
her simple surgery.</p>

<p>In the course of a few minutes the dizzy sensation of faintness
that had been produced by loss of blood, passed away,
and the delighted Prairie&ndash;bird, seeing on his countenance the
beaming smile of returning consciousness and strength, murmured
to herself, “Oh! God I thank thee!” then hiding her
face in her hands, wept with mingled emotion and gratitude.
Reginald heard the words, he marked the tears, and no longer
able to suppress the feelings with which his heart overflowed,
he drew her gently towards him with his yet unwounded arm,
and whispered in her ear the outpourings of a first, fond, passionate
love!</p>

<p>No reply came from her lips, her tears (tears of intense
emotion) flowed yet faster; but a sensible pressure on the
part of the little hand which he clasped within his own, gave
him the blest assurance that his love was returned; and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and again did he repeat those sacred and impassioned vows by
which the hopes, the fears, the fortunes, the affections, the
very existence of two immortal beings, are inseparably blended
together. Her unresisting hand remained clasped in his, and
her head leaned upon his shoulder, that she might conceal the
blushes that suffused her countenance: still he would not be
satisfied without a verbal answer to his thrice urged prayer,
that he might call her his own; and when at length she raised
her beaming eyes to his, and audibly whispered, “For ever,”
he sealed upon those sweet lips the contract of unchanged
affection.</p>

<p>Bright, transitory moments of bliss! lightning flashes that
illumine the dark and stormy path of life, though momentary
in your duration, how mighty in your power, how lasting in
your effects! Sometimes imparting a rapturous glow and
kindling an unceasing heat that death itself cannot extinguish,
and sometimes under a star of evil destiny searing and withering
the heart rendered desolate by your scorching flame!</p>

<p>It is not necessary to inform the gentle reader how long the
<i>tête&ndash;à&ndash;tête</i> on the fallen tree continued; suffice it to say, that
Prairie&ndash;bird forgot her fright, and Reginald his wounds; and
when they returned to the village, each sought to enjoy in
solitude those delicious reveries which deserve certainly the
second place in love’s catalogue of happiness.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">ETHELSTON PREPARES TO LEAVE MOOSHANNE.—MAHÉGA APPEARS AS
AN ORATOR, IN WHICH CHARACTER HE SUCCEEDS BETTER THAN IN
THAT OF A LOVER.—A STORM SUCCEEDED BY A CALM.</p>

<p class="pn">While the events described in the last chapter were in progress,
the hours sped smoothly onward at Mooshanne. Lucy
and Ethelston thought themselves justly entitled to a liberal
compensation for the trials of their long separation; and, as
the spring advanced, morning and evening generally found
them strolling together, in the enjoyment of its opening beauties.
Sometimes Aunt Mary encountered them during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
busy round of her visits to the poultry, the piggery, or to the
cottage of some neighbour, whither sorrow or sickness called
her. The mate frequently came over from Marietta to see his
captain, and to inquire whether there was no early prospect of
another voyage, for he already began to find that time travelled
slowly ashore; and although he consoled himself, now
and then, with a pipe and social glass in David Muir’s back
parlour, he longed to be afloat again, and told the worthy
merchant that he would rather have made the fresh&ndash;water
trip in the canoe, than be laid up in dock, while he felt his
old hull still stout and seaworthy. His son Henry continued
to advance in the good graces of Jessie Muir; but unfortunately
for the youth his father had discovered his attachment,
and lost no opportunity of bantering him in the presence of
the young lady, accompanying his jokes with sundry grins,
and severe pokes in the ribs, which caused sometimes a disagreeable
alternation of vexation and confusion: nevertheless
David Muir remained habitually blind to the state of his
daughter’s affections, and Dame Christie was a great deal too
much occupied with the cares of domestic government (including
the occasional lectures and reproofs administered to
David) to admit of her troubling her head with what she
would have termed their childish fancies.</p>

<p>Such was the general state of affairs on the banks of the
Muskingum, when Colonel Brandon received letters from St.
Louis, informing him that, since the departure of his son,
various disputes had arisen between the agents of the different
companies, and that unless a speedy and amicable arrangement
could be effected, a heavy loss must necessarily fall upon the
fur&ndash;proprietors and others interested in the speculation. By
the same post a letter bearing a foreign post&ndash;mark was placed
in the hands of Ethelston, during the perusal of which, an expression
of sadness spread itself over his countenance, and he
fell abstractedly into a reverie, the subject of which was
evidently of a painful nature. Such indications were not
likely to escape the anxious and observant eye of love; and
Lucy, laying her hand lightly on his arm, said in a tone half
joking, half serious, “Am I not entitled to know all your
secrets now, Edward?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” he replied in the same tone; “and I am
rather disposed to refuse gratifying your curiosity, until you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
consent to acquiring such a title as shall be indisputable.”
Lucy coloured; but as she still held out her hand and threatened
him with her displeasure, if he continued disobedient, he
gave her the letter, saying, “I suppose I must submit; the
contents are sad, but there is no reason why I should withhold
them from yourself, or from your father.” With these words
he left the room: after a short pause, Lucy, at the Colonel’s
request, read him the letter, which proved to be from young
Lieutenant L’Estrange, and which, being translated, ran as
follows:—</p>

<p class="pbqh p1">“My Honoured Friend,</p>

<p class="pbq">“I need not tell you of the grief that I experienced on
revisiting my changed and desolate home. My father has
told me all that passed during your stay in the island. He
looks upon those days not in anger, but in sorrow; he is sensible
that for a time he did you injustice, and fears that, in
the first bitterness of his grief, he may have omitted to make
you full reparation. These feelings he entreats me to convey
to you, and desires me to add, that from the first day of your
arrival, to that of your final departure, your conduct was like
yourself,—noble, upright, and generous. The misfortune
that we still bewail, we bow to, as being the infliction of a
Providence whose ways are inscrutable. Accept the renewed
assurance of the highest regard and esteem of your friend,</p>

<p class="pbqr">“<span class="smcap">Eugene L’Estrange</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">As Lucy read this letter, her eyes filled with tears, though,
perhaps, she could scarcely have explained, whether she wept
over the afflictions that had befallen the L’Estrange family,
or the generous testimony which it bore to her lover’s conduct.
The Colonel, too, was much affected, and gladly acquiesced in
his daughter’s proposal, that they should for the future
abstain from renewing a subject which must cause such
painful recollections to Ethelston.</p>

<p>Ere many hours had elapsed, the latter was summoned to
attend the Colonel, who informed him that the intelligence
lately received from St. Louis was of a nature so important
to his affairs, that it required immediate attention. “There
is no one,” he continued, “to whom I can well entrust this
investigation, except yourself, for none has deserved or received
so much of my confidence.” There was an unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
embarrassment and hesitation observable in Ethelston’s countenance,
on hearing these words, which did not escape his
guardian’s quick eye, and the latter added, “I see, my dear
fellow, that you are not disposed to leave Mooshanne again so
soon; you are thinking about certain promises, and a certain
young lady,—is it not so, Edward?”</p>

<p>“It is so, indeed, my best and kindest of friends,” said
Ethelston. “Can you think or wish that it should be otherwise?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Colonel Brandon, smiling, “I will not deny
that you are entitled to entertain such thoughts, but believe
me, when I assure you seriously that this expedition is essential
to your own interests and to mine. A great portion of the
property left to you under my care by your father, is invested
in these Fur companies; and ere you enter on the responsibilities
of a married life, it is necessary that you put your
affairs in such a posture, as to ensure some future provision
for the lady of whom you are thinking. These arrangements
will not detain you at St. Louis for more than six weeks or
two months, by that time Reginald will have returned from
his Indian excursion; you will come home together, and I
will then listen patiently to whatever you may think fit to say,
regarding the young lady in question;—shall it be so,
Edward?”</p>

<p>“How can I be grateful enough!” replied Ethelston, taking
the Colonel’s hand; “give me only leave to explain to Lucy
the cause and probable duration of my absence, then I am
ready to receive your instructions, and to set about it immediately.”
We will not inquire too minutely how Lucy received
this explanation from her lover’s lip, nor what means
he took to reconcile her to the proposed arrangement; it is
sufficient to state, that she finally acquiesced with her habitual
gentleness, and that, in a few days after the above conversation,
Ethelston had completed his preparations for his journey to
St. Louis.</p>

<p>We will again take leave of him and of Mooshanne for a
season, and return to Mahéga, whom we left bleeding and
senseless, at no great distance from the Osage and Delaware
encampment. Indeed, we should, ere this, have accused ourselves
of inhumanity towards that chief, for leaving him so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in such sorry plight, had he not merited severe punishment,
for his rough and brutal behaviour to Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p>When Mahéga recovered his senses, he was still so much
confused from the stunning effects of the severe blow that he
had received on the head, as well as from loss of blood, that
he could not recall to mind the events immediately preceding
his swoon; nor did they present themselves distinctly to his
memory, until his eye rested upon his stained scalp&ndash;lock, and
beside it the knife that Reginald Brandon had driven firmly
into the turf. Then he remembered clearly enough the
struggle, his fall, and the maiden’s escape; and the rage engendered
by this remembrance was rendered yet more violent,
when he reflected on the insult that his scalp had sustained
from an enemy who had scorned to take his life.</p>

<p>Fierce as were the passions that boiled within the breast of
the Osage, his self&ndash;command was such that he was able to
control all outward demonstration of them; and, rising slowly,
he first effaced in the stream all the sanguinary marks of the
late contest, and then took his way toward the camp, revolving
in his mind various projects for securing the two principal
objects that he was determined to accomplish,—the possession
of Prairie&ndash;bird, and the death of Reginald Brandon!</p>

<p>Although a wild uninstructed savage, Mahéga was gifted
with talents of no common order. Bold, and inflexible in
carrying out his purposes, he had cunning sufficient to make
unimportant concessions to the opinions of other chiefs and
braves in council: unlike the great majority of his tribe and
race, he was well aware of the power and strength resulting
from union, and although all his ambition ultimately centred
in himself, he had the art of persuading his countrymen that
he sought only their interests and welfare; thus, while many
hated, and more feared Mahéga, he was the most influential
chief in the tribe, on account of his daring courage, his success
in war, and the reckless liberality with which he distributed
among others his share of booty, or of spoil. When the Delaware
band had migrated to the banks of the Osage river,
Mahéga’s first impulse had been to attack and destroy them;
but finding that the new comers were better supplied with
arms and ammunition, the issue of a conflict seemed doubtful.
Moreover, as they were visited by many traders, he calculated
that, by keeping on friendly terms with them, he should acquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
for his tribe, and for himself, many advantages greater
than they had before enjoyed.</p>

<p>Acting upon these motives, he had not only encouraged peace
with the Delawares, but had effected through his own influence
the league that had for some time united the two bands
in our encampment; nor had he been mistaken in his expectations,
for, since their union with the band of Delawares, the
Osages had been enabled to beat off the Pawnees and other
roving tribes, from whose inroads upon their hunting&ndash;ground
they had before been exposed to frequent and severe disasters;
the objects which he had contemplated, had thus been for the
most part accomplished. The tribe was plentifully supplied
with arms and ammunition by the traders; his own influence
amongst them was higher than ever; but he could not brook a
rival to his fame as a warrior in War&ndash;Eagle, nor bear to be
checked and thwarted in his ambitious schemes, by the mild
authority of Tamenund.</p>

<p>The mind of Mahéga being thus prepared for seizing the
earliest opportunity of coming to a rupture with the Delawares
it may well be imagined how his most violent and rancorous
passions were excited by the scornful rejection of his suit on
the part of Prairie&ndash;bird, and the disgrace he had incurred in his
rencounter with her white protector. He resolved no longer to
delay the meditated blow; he had already made a secret league
with the warlike and powerful Dahcotahs; and the occasion
seemed most favourable for wreaking his vengeance on the relatives
of Prairie&ndash;bird, and the white men now resident in the
Delaware camp.</p>

<p>Having once formed his determination, he set about carrying
it into effect with the sagacity and profound dissimulation
which had already obtained for him such an ascendancy in the
Osage council. No sooner had he reached his lodge, than he
dressed himself in his Medicine robe<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, adorned his face with
corresponding streaks of paint, and concealing the loss of his
scalp&ndash;lock by a Spanish kerchief, which he folded round his
head, somewhat after the fashion of a turban, he sallied forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to visit the chiefs and braves, on whose co&ndash;operation he felt
that success must mainly depend.</p>

<p>Some of these were already prepared to adopt his views, by
their previous participation in the league with the Dahcotahs;
others he bent and moulded to his purpose by arguments and
inducements suited to their character or circumstances; and
ere he returned to his lodge, he felt confident that his proposed
plans would be supported by the most influential warriors in
the tribe, and that he should easily bear down the opposition
of the more cautious and scrupulous, who might be disposed
to keep faith with their Delaware allies.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile War&ndash;Eagle was not idle, he visited the
principal braves and warriors of his tribe, and found them
unanimous in their resolution to break off all communication
with the Osages, as soon as the latter should commit any overt
act that should justify them in dissolving the league into which
they had entered. He also resolved to watch closely the movements
of Mahéga, of whose malice and influence he was fully
aware; with this view he selected an intelligent Delaware boy,
who knew the Osage language, and desired him to hover about
the tent of the chief, and to bring a report of all that he should
see or hear.</p>

<p>Towards the close of day, Mahéga sent runners about his
village, after the usual Indian fashion, to summon the warriors
and braves, most of whom were already prepared for the
harangue which he was about to address to them; as soon as
a sufficient number were collected, the wily chief came forth
from his lodge, in the dress before described, and began by
thanking them for so readily obeying his call.</p>

<p>“Why did Mahéga call together the warriors?” he continued;
“Was it to tell them that a broad bison&ndash;trail is near
the camp? The Medicine&ndash;men have not yet smoked the
hunting&ndash;pipe to the Wahcondah.—Was it to tell them of the
scalps taken by their fathers? The young men have not been
called to the war&ndash;dance, their ears have not heard the Drum.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>—Was
it to tickle their ears with words like dried grass?
Mahéga’s tongue is not spread with honey; he has called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Washashe to open their ears and eyes, to tell them that snakes
have crept under their lodges, that the dogs in the village have
become wolves!”</p>

<p>As he paused, the auditors looked each at the other; those
who were not yet instructed in the speaker’s project being at a
loss to catch the meaning of his words. Seeing that he had
arrested their attention, he proceeded: “When Mahéga was
young, when our fathers were warriors, who was so strong as
the Washashe? Our hunters killed the deer and the bison
from the Neska to the Topeo&ndash;kà.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The Konzas were our brothers,
and we were afraid of none. But the Mahe&ndash;hunguh<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
came near, their tongues were smooth, their hands were full,
and the Washashe listened to their talk:—is it not so?”</p>

<p>A deep murmur testified the attention of his auditors; but
Mahéga knew that he was venturing on dangerous ground,
and his present object was rather to incite them to vengeance
against the band of Delawares and their guests, than against
the white men in general. He resumed his harangue in a
milder tone.</p>

<p>“The Long&ndash;knives smoked the pipe of peace with us, we
gave them meat and skins, and they gave us paint and blankets,
and fire&ndash;weapons with Medicine&ndash;powder and lead,—all
that was well; but who came with the Long&ndash;knives,—the
Lenapé!” He paused a moment, then looking fiercely round,
he continued in a louder strain; “and who are these Lenapé?
They were beggars when they came to us! Their skin is red,
but their hearts are pale. Do we not know the tale of their
fathers? Were they not slaves to the warriors of other nations?<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Were they not women? Did they not leave the
war&ndash;path to plant maize, and drink the fire&ndash;water of the Long&ndash;knives?
They gave up their hunting&ndash;ground; they left the
bones of their fathers; they crossed the Ne&ndash;o&ndash;hunge<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, and
asked for the friendship of the Washashe. We lighted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
pipe for them; we received them like brothers, and opened to
them our hunting&ndash;ground; but their hearts are bad to us,
Washashes. Mahéga tells you that the Lenapé are snakes!”</p>

<p>Another deep guttural sound, indicative of increased excitement,
gratified the speaker’s ear, and he continued in a strain
yet bolder: “Is Mahéga not a chief? Has he not struck
the bodies of his enemies? Are there no scalps on his war&ndash;shirt?
He was good to these Lenapé, he treated their warriors
like brothers, he offered to make Olitipa his wife, they gave
him bitter words and threw dirt upon his lodge. Shall the
Washashe Chief be called a dog?” he exclaimed in a voice of
thunder; “Shall he sit on the ground while a Lenapé spits in
his face?”</p>

<p>A shout of anger and fury burst from the audience, as, waving
his hand impatiently for silence, he went on: “The Lenapé
knew that their hearts were false, their arms weak, their
tongues forked, and they have brought in a band of Long&ndash;knives
to defend them and to drive the Washashe from their
hunting&ndash;grounds. Shall it be so? Shall we hold our backs
to be scourged like children? Shall we whine like starved
wolves? See how the pale faces can insult your chief!” As
he spoke, Mahéga tore the turban with one hand from his head,
and holding up his severed scalp&ndash;lock with the other, while
every muscle of his countenance worked with fury, “See what
the hand of a white&ndash;face boy has done. Mahéga slept under a
tree, and he whom they call Netis, the stranger who has eaten
our meat and smoked with our chiefs, stole upon Mahéga,
struck him on the head, and cut off his hair.” As he uttered
this audacious falsehood, which was, of course, believed by all
who heard him, a terrific shout burst from the assembled
Osages, and the wily chief, striking while the iron was hot,
went on:—</p>

<p>“It is enough—the Washashes are not women; they will
dig up the hatchet, and throw it into the council lodge of these
white&ndash;faced and pale&ndash;hearted dogs. The great chief of the
Dahcotahs has spoken to Mahéga; he seeks the friendship of
the Washashes; the Dahcotahs are men; the bisons on their
hunting&ndash;grounds are like the leaves in the forest. They wish to
call the Washashes brothers, they wait for Mahéga’s words.—What
shall he say?”</p>

<p>A tremendous shout was raised in reply, a shout that could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
be heard throughout the whole encampment. Mahéga saw
that his triumph was complete, and folding his Medicine robe
over his shoulder, he once more waved his hand for silence,
and dismissed the assembly, saying, “Before the sun sinks
again the chiefs and braves will meet in council. The Washashes
will hear their words and they will be ready.” As he
spoke he cast his dark eye expressively downwards to the tomahawk
suspended at his belt, and slowly re&ndash;entered his lodge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the youth who had been sent by War&ndash;Eagle to
observe what was passing in the Osage encampment, executed
his commission with fidelity and address. Although not sufficiently
familiar with the language to catch all that fell from
Mahéga, he yet learnt enough to satisfy his young chief that
a rupture was at hand. It only remained now to be proved
whether it would take place as the result of an open council, or
whether the Osages would withdraw secretly to their new Dahcotah
allies.</p>

<p>On the morning succeeding the events above related, War&ndash;Eagle
left the encampment before daybreak, partly to see whether
he could discover any unusual stir among the Osages, and
partly to revolve in his mind the course of conduct that he
should suggest if called upon to give his opinion before the
Lenapé council. Many various emotions were struggling in
his bosom, and in this respect the descendants of Adam, whether
their skins be white or red, so far resemble each other,
that on such occasions they seek to avoid the turmoil of their
fellow&ndash;men, and to be for a season alone amid the works of
inanimate nature.</p>

<p>It was with impressions and feelings far different that Reginald
and Prairie&ndash;bird found themselves soon after sunrise together,
as if by tacit appointment, by the great tree, under which
he had first seen her. In order to guard against the treachery
of which he believed Mahéga capable, he had communicated to
Baptiste the events of the preceding morning, and had desired
him to watch the movements of the latter, especially
guarding Prairie&ndash;bird against any renewal of his violence.—The
trusty forester, who had grown extremely taciturn since he
had observed his young master’s attachment, shrugged his
shoulders, and briefly promised to obey his instructions. He
was too shrewd to oppose a torrent such as that by which
Reginald was carried away; and, although it must be confessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
that he had many misgivings as to the reception that the
tidings would meet with at the hands of Colonel Brandon, the
beauty and gentleness of Prairie&ndash;bird had so far won upon his
rough nature that he was well disposed to protect her from the
machinations of the Osage. With these intentions he followed
her when she left her lodge, and as soon as she entered the
thicket before described, he ensconced himself in a shady corner
whence he could observe the approach of any party from
the encampment.</p>

<p>We will now follow the steps of War&ndash;Eagle, who, having
satisfied himself by a careful observation of the out piquette
that no immediate movement was on foot among the Osages,
turned towards the undulating prairies to the westward of the
village.</p>

<p>He was in an uneasy and excited mood, both from the
treachery of the Osages towards his tribe, and various occurrences
which had of late wounded his feelings in the quarter
where they were most sensitive.</p>

<p>The victory over self is the greatest that can be achieved by
man; it assumes, however, a different complexion in those who
are guided by the light of nature, and in those who have been
taught by revelation. In the heathen it is confined to the
actions and to the outward man, whereas in the Christian it
extends to the motives and feelings of the heart. The former
may spare an enemy, the latter must learn to forgive and love
him. But in both cases the struggle is severe in proportion to
the strength of the passion which is to be combated. In War&ndash;Eagle
were combined many of the noblest features of the Indian
character; but his passions had all the fierce intensity common
to his race; and although the instructions of Paul Müller, falling
like good seed on a wild but fertile soil, had humanised and
improved him, his views of Christianity were incipient and
indistinct, while the courage, pride, and feelings of his race
were in the full zenith of their power. He had long known
that Prairie&ndash;bird was not his sister in blood, she had grown up
from childhood under his eye, and, unconsciously perhaps at
first, he had loved her, and still loved her with all the impassioned
fervour of his nature. It may be remembered in the
earlier portion of this tale, when he first became acquainted with
Reginald, that he had abstained from all mention of her name,
and had avoided the subject whenever young Wingenund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
brought it forward. He had never yet asked Olitipa to become
his wife, but the sweet gentleness of her manner, and her open
contempt for the addresses of the handsome and distinguished
Osage, had led him to form expectations favourable to his own
suit. At the same time there was something in the maiden’s
behaviour that had frequently caused him to doubt whether
she loved him, and sharing in the awe with which she inspired
all the Indians around her, he had hitherto hesitated and feared
to make a distinct avowal. Of late he had been so much
occupied in observing the suspicious movements of the Osages
that his attention had been somewhat withdrawn from Olitipa:
he was aware of her having become acquainted with Reginald,
and the adventure of the preceding day, which had been communicated
to him, filled him with an uneasiness that he could
not conceal from himself, although he had succeeded in concealing
it from others.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind, he was returning to the camp, along
the course of the streamlet passing through the grove where
the rencounter of the preceding day had occurred. When he
reached the opening before described, his eyes rested on a sight
that transfixed him to the spot. Seated on one of the projecting
roots of the ancient tree was Prairie&ndash;bird, her eye and
cheek glowing with happiness, and her ear drinking in the
whispered vows of her newly&ndash;betrothed lover; her hand was
clasped in his, and more than once he pressed it tenderly to
his lips. For several minutes the Indian stood silent and motionless
as a statue; despair seemed to have checked the current
of his blood, but by slow degrees consciousness returned;
he saw her, the maiden whom he had served and loved for
weary months and years, now interchanging with another
tokens of affection not to be mistaken, and that other a stranger
whom he had himself lately brought by his own invitation
from a distant region.</p>

<p>The demon of jealousy took instant possession of his soul;
every other thought, feeling, and passion was for the time
annihilated, the nobler impulses of his nature were forgotten,
and he was in a moment transformed to a merciless savage,
bent on swift and deadly vengeance. He only paused as in
doubt, <i>how</i> he should kill his rival—perhaps, whether he
should kill them both; his eye dwelt upon them with a
stern ferocity, as he loosened the unerring tomahawk from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
belt; another moment he paused, for his hand trembled convulsively,
and a cold sweat stood like dew upon his brow. At
this terrible crisis of his passion, a low voice whispered in his
ear, in the Delaware tongue,</p>

<p>“Would the Lenapé chief stain his Medicine with a brother’s
blood?” War&ndash;Eagle, turning round, encountered the
steady eye of Baptiste; he gave no answer, but directed his
fiery glance towards the spot where the unconscious lovers
were seated, and the half&ndash;raised weapon still vibrated under
the impulse of the internal struggle that shook every muscle
of the Indian’s frame. Profiting by the momentary pause,
Baptiste continued, in the same tone, “Shall the tomahawk
of the War&ndash;Eagle strike an adopted son of the Unâmi?<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The Bad Spirit has entered my brother’s heart; let him hold
a talk with himself, and remember that he is the son of
Tamenund.”</p>

<p>By an effort of self&ndash;control, such as none but an Indian can
exercise, War&ndash;Eagle subdued, instantaneously, all outward indication
of the tempest that had been aroused in his breast.
Replacing the tomahawk in his belt, he drew himself proudly
to his full height, and, fixing on the woodsman an eye calm
and steady as his own, he replied,</p>

<p>“Grande&ndash;Hâche speaks truth; War&ndash;Eagle is a chief; the
angry spirit is strong; but he tramples it under his feet.”
He then added, in a lower tone, “War&ndash;Eagle will speak to
Netis; not now; if his white brother’s tongue has been forked,
the medicine of the Unâmi shall not protect him. The sky is
very black, and War&ndash;Eagle has no friend left.” So saying,
the Indian threw his light blanket over his shoulder and
stalked gloomily from the spot.</p>

<p>Baptiste followed with his eye the retreating figure of the
Delaware, until it was lost in the dense foliage of the wood.</p>

<p>“He <i>is</i> a noble fellow,” said the rough hunter, half aloud,
leaning on his long rifle, and pursuing the thread of his own
reflections. “He is one of the old sort of Ingians, and there’s
but few of ‘em left. I’ve been with him in several skrimages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and I’ve seen him strike and scalp more than one Dahcotah;
but I never saw the glare of his eye so wild and bloodthirsty
before; if he had kept his purpose, my old sinews would have
had some trouble to save Master Reginald from that tomahawk.
It’s well for him that I’ve lived long enough among the Delawares
to know the ins and outs of their natur’, as well as John
Skellup at the ferry knows the sand&ndash;bars and channels in
Bearcreek Shallows. I thought the Unâmi Medicine whispered
in his ear might do something; but I scarcely hoped it could
smother such a fire in a minute. I remember, when I was
young, I was in a hot passion, now and then, myself. <i>Capote!</i>
I’m sometimes in a passion still, when I think of those cut&ndash;throat
Sioux, and if my bristles are up, it takes some time to
smooth ‘em down.” Here the woodsman’s hand unconsciously
rested for a moment on the huge axe suspended at his belt;
but his musings took another course, as he continued his muttered
soliloquy:—</p>

<p>“Well, I sometimes think the bears and the deer have more
reason than human critturs, ay, and I believe that shot isn’t
overwide o’ the mark. Look at them two youngsters, Master
Reginald and War&ndash;Eagle, two brave honest hearts as ever
lived; one saves the other’s life; they become brothers and
swear friendship; of a sudden, I am obliged to step in between
‘em, to prevent one from braining the other with a
tomahawk. And what’s the cause of all this hate and fury?
Why, love,—a pair of black eyes and red lips;—a strange
kind of love, indeed, that makes a man hate and kill his best
friend. Thank Heaven, I have nothing to do with such love;
and I say, as I said before, that the dumb animals have more
reason than human critturs. Well, I must do all I can to
make ‘em friends again, for a blind man might see they’ll
need each other’s help, ere many days are past!”</p>

<p>So saying, the woodsman threw his rifle into the hollow of
his arm, and moved towards Reginald Brandon, who, unconscious
of the danger that he had so narrowly escaped, was still
engaged with Prairie&ndash;bird in that loving dialogue which finds
no satiety in endless reiteration.</p>

<p>Baptiste drew near, and after the usual greetings, took an
opportunity, as he thought unobserved by Prairie&ndash;bird, of
making a sign to Reginald that he wished to speak with him in
private; but the maiden, watchful of every movement directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
or indirectly affecting her lover, and already aware of the
intrigues and treachery of the Osages, said to him with her
usual simplicity of manner, “Baptiste, if you have aught to
say requiring my absence, I will go; but as there are dangers
approaching that threaten us all alike, do not fear to speak
before me. I know something of these people, and though
only an unskilled maiden, my thoughts might be of some
avail.”</p>

<p>The sturdy hunter, although possessed of a shrewd judgment,
was somewhat confused by this direct appeal; but after
smoothing down the hair of his fur cap for a few moments, as
was his custom when engaged in reflection, he resolved to speak
before her without concealment; and he proceeded accordingly,
with the blunt honesty of his nature, to narrate to them all
the particulars of his late interview with War&ndash;Eagle. During
his recital, both the auditors changed colour more than once,
with different yet sympathetic emotions; and when he concluded,
Reginald suddenly arose, and, fixing his eye upon the
maiden’s countenance, as if he would read her soul, he said,</p>

<p>“Prairie&ndash;bird, I conjure you by all you love on earth, and
by all your hopes of Heaven! tell me truly, if you have known
and encouraged these feelings in War&ndash;Eagle?”</p>

<p>The dark eyes that had been cast to the ground with various
painful emotions were raised at this appeal, and met her lover’s
searching look with the modest courage of conscious truth as
she replied,—</p>

<p>“Reginald, is it possible that you can ask me such a question?
Olitipa, the foundling of the Delawares, loved War&ndash;Eagle
as she loved Wingenund; she was brought up in the
same lodge with both; she called both, brother; she thought
of them only as such. Had War&ndash;Eagle ever asked for other
love, she would have told him she had none other to give.
She knew of none other, until—until——” The presence of
a third person checked the words that struggled for utterance;
her deep eyes filled with tears, and she hid them on Reginald’s
bosom.</p>

<p>“I were worse than an infidel, could I doubt thy purity
and truth,” he exclaimed with fervour; “Baptiste, I will
speak with my Indian brother—I pity him from my heart—I
will strive all in my power to soothe his sorrow; for I, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
I alone, can know what <i>he</i> must suffer, who has, in secret and
in vain, loved such a being as this! Let us return.”</p>

<p>Slowly and sadly they wended their way to the encampment,
the guide bringing up the rear. He was thoroughly
convinced that Prairie&ndash;bird had spoken the truth: every look,
every accent carried conviction with it; but he feared for the
meeting between the young men, being fully aware of the impetuosity
of Reginald’s character, and of the intense excitement
that now affected the Indian’s mind. He determined, however,
to leave them to themselves, for he had lived enough
among men of stormy and ungoverned passions to know, that
in a <i>tête&ndash;à&ndash;tête</i> between two high and generous spirits a concession
will often be made, to which pride might, in the presence
of others, never have submitted.</p>

<p>On reaching their quarters in the encampment, they found
Paul Müller standing thoughtfully before Prairie&ndash;bird’s tent,
into which, after exchanging a brief but cordial greeting, he
and the maiden withdrew, leaving Reginald and the guide to
retire into the adjoining lodge of Tamenund.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle, who had posted himself in a spot whence,
without being seen himself, he could observe their movements,
now walked slowly forward to the entrance of the tent, into
which he was immediately invited by the missionary; his
manner was grave and composed, nor could the most observant
eye have traced in the lines of his countenance the slightest
shade of excitement or agitation.</p>

<p>After the usual salutation, he said, “War&ndash;Eagle will speak
to the Black Father presently; he has now low words for the
ear of Olitipa.”</p>

<p>Paul Müller, looking on him with a smile, benevolent
though somewhat melancholy, said, “I shut my ears, my son,
and go, for I know that War&ndash;Eagle will speak nothing that
his sister should not hear;” and so saying, he retired into his
adjacent compartment of the tent. Prairie&ndash;bird, conscious of
the painful scene that awaited her, sat in embarrassed silence,
and for upwards of a minute War&ndash;Eagle contemplated without
speaking the sad but lovely expression of the maiden’s countenance;
that long and piercing look told him all that he
dreaded to know; he saw that Baptiste had spoken to her; he
saw that his hopes were blasted; and still his riveted gaze was
fixed upon her, as the eyes of one banished for life dwell upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the last receding tints of the home that he is leaving for ever.
Collecting, at length, all the stoic firmness of his nature, he
spoke to her in the Delaware tongue; the words that he used
were few and simple, but in them, and in the tone of his
voice, there was so much delicacy mingled with such depth of
feeling, that Prairie&ndash;bird could not refrain from tears.</p>

<p>Answering him in the same language, she blended her accustomed
sincerity of expression with gentle words of soothing
kindness; and, in concluding her reply, she took his hand in
hers, saying, “Olitipa has long loved her brothers, War&ndash;Eagle
and Wingenund; let not a cloud come between them now; her
heart is not changed to the great warrior of Lenapé; his sister
trusts to his protection; she is proud of his fame; she has no
other love to give him; her race, her religion, her heart forbid
it! but he is her dear brother; he will not be angry, nor leave
her.</p>

<p>“Mahéga and the Osages are become enemies; the Dahcotah
trail is near; Tamenund is old and weak; where shall
Olitipa find a brother’s love, and a brother’s aid, if War&ndash;Eagle
turns away his face from her now?”</p>

<p>The noble heart to which she appealed had gone through its
fiery ordeal of torture, and triumphed over it. After the manner
of his tribe, the Delaware, before relinquishing her hand,
pressed it for a moment to his chest, in token of affection, and
said, “It is enough; my sister’s words are good, they are not
spilt upon the ground; let Mahéga or the Dahcotahs come
near the lodge of Olitipa, and they shall learn that War&ndash;Eagle
is her brother!” The chieftain’s hand rested lightly on his
tomahawk, and his countenance, as he withdrew from the tent,
wore an expression of high and stern resolve.</p>

<p>How often in life is the observation forced upon us, that
artlessness is the highest perfection of art! It is an axiom,
the truth of which remains unchallenged under whatever aspect
we view it, and is indisputable even in its converse; thus, as
in writing, the apparent ease and simplicity of style is the result
of frequent correction and laborious study; so in corporeal
exercises, the most assiduous practice must be combined with
the highest physical qualifications, ere the dancer or the posture&ndash;master
can emulate the unconscious grace displayed in the
movements of a sportive kitten, or a playful child.</p>

<p>Had Prairie&ndash;bird been familiar with all the learned treatises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
on rhetoric that have appeared from the time of Aristotle to
the present day, she could not have selected topics better calculated
to move and soften the heart of her Indian brother.
And yet she had no other instructor in the heart than the natural
delicacy of her sex and character. While the tribute to his
warlike fame gratified his pride, the unstudied sisterly affection
of her tone and manner soothed his wounded feelings; and
while the brief picture of her unprotected state aroused all his
nobler and more generous sentiments, no breath of allusion to
his successful rival’s name kindled the embers of jealousy that
slumbered beneath them.</p>

<p>As he walked from her tent, the young Indian’s heart dilated
within him; he trod the earth with a proud and lordly
step; he had grappled with his passion; and though it had been
riveted “to his soul with hooks of steel,” he had plucked it
forth with an unflinching hand, and he now met his deep&ndash;rooted
grief with the same lofty brow and unconquerable will
with which he would have braved the tortures of the Dahcotah
stake.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A MORAL DISQUISITION SOMEWHAT
TEDIOUS, A TRUE STORY SOMEWHAT INCREDIBLE, A CONFERENCE
THAT ENDS IN PEACE, AND A COUNCIL THAT BETOKENS WAR.</p>

<p class="pn">It is not a feature in the character of Indians to do anything
by halves; their love and their hate, their patience and impatience,
their abstinence and self&ndash;indulgence, all are apt to run
into extremes. Moderation is essentially a virtue of civilisation;
it is the result of forethought, reasoning, and a careful
calculation of consequences, whereas the qualities of the Indian
are rather the children of impulse, and are less modified by
conflicting motives; hence, the lights and shades of character
are broader and more distinct; and though it may be perhaps
impossible that Indian villany should assume a deeper dye
than that which may unfortunately be met with among civilised
nations, it is not asserting too much to say, that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
are to be found among these savages instances of disinterested,
self&ndash;devoted heroism, such as are rarely heard of beyond the
world of chivalry and romance.</p>

<p>This assertion will be received by many readers with an incredulous
smile, and still more will be disposed to believe that
it can be true only in reference to such virtues or actions as are
the immediate result of a generous impulse; but examples are
not wanting to prove the argument to be defensible upon higher
grounds. It will readily be admitted, that retributive justice,
although consonant to the first principles of reason and natural
law, cannot, when deliberately enforced, be considered in the
light of a sudden impulse, much less can it be so considered
when the party enforcing it is to be himself the sufferer by it;
and those who are conversant with the history of the Indian
nations can testify that parallel instances to that which follows
have frequently occurred among them.</p>

<p>Some years ago, a young married Indian, residing on the
western bank of the Mississippi, quarrelled with another of his
tribe, and in the heat of passion killed him with a blow of his
tomahawk. After a few moments’ reflection, he walked direct
to the village, and presenting himself before the wigwam of
the murdered man, called together his relations, and addressed
them as follows:</p>

<p>“Your relative was my friend; we were together,—some
angry words arose between us,—I killed him on the spot.
My life is in your hands, and I have come to offer it to you;
but the summer hunting&ndash;season has now begun. I have a
wife and some young children; they have done you no wrong;
I wish to go out into the woods to kill a plentiful supply of
meat, such as may feed them during the winter; when I have
done that, I will return and give myself to you.”</p>

<p>The stern assembly of mourners gave their assent, and the
young man retired; for many weeks he toiled indefatigably in
the chase, his wife jerked and dried the meat as he daily
brought it in, until he saw that the supply was ample for the
ensuing winter; he then bid farewell to her and to his little
ones, and once more presenting himself before the wigwam of
his late friend, he said, “I am come: my squaw has meat for
the winter, my life is now yours!” To these words the eldest
male relative of the deceased replied, “It is well:” and rising
from the ground, executed on the unresisting offender the summary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
justice of Indian retribution, by cleaving his skull with a
tomahawk. Neither the self&ndash;devotion of the one, nor the unrelenting
severity of the other, excited any peculiar sensation,
each having acted according to the strict, though barbarous
usage of the tribe.</p>

<p>Amongst a people accustomed to look with stoic composure
on scenes such as that just described, War&ndash;Eagle had already
won a distinguished name, and he supported it on this trying
occasion by resigning what was dearer to him than life, and
crushing, as under a weight of iron, that passion which had
been for years the hope and nourishment of his heart; whether,
albeit crushed and smothered, it still lingered there, is a secret
which it is neither our wish nor our province to betray, but
regarding which the reader may form his own opinion from
the subsequent conduct of the chief.</p>

<p>His first step was to seek Reginald Brandon, whom he desired,
by a silent signal, to leave the lodge and follow him.
Our hero mechanically obeyed, in a painful state of excitement
and agitation, feeling that he had been the unconscious means
of blasting all the dearest hopes of his Indian friend; and
although he had intended no injury, he was sensible that he
had done one, such as man can rarely forgive, and can never
repair; for even had the romantic generosity of friendship
prompted him to resign all pretensions to Prairie&ndash;bird, he felt
that such a resignation, while he was secure of her affections,
would be mere mockery and insult. He knew also how prominent
a feature is revenge in the Indian character, and
thought it not improbable that he might be now following his
conductor to some secluded spot, where their rivalry should be
decided by mortal strife, and the survivor return to claim the
lovely prize. This last thought, which would, under any
other circumstances, have nerved his arm and made his heart
exult within him, now overwhelmed him with sadness, for he
loved both Wingenund and War&ndash;Eagle, they were endeared to
him by reciprocal benefits, and he shrunk from a quarrel with
the latter as from a fratricide.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Indian strode rapidly forward; neither
could Reginald detect the feelings that lurked beneath the dignified
and unmoved composure of his countenance.</p>

<p>After walking in silence for some minutes, they reached a
small hollow, where a few scattered alder&ndash;bushes screened them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
from the observation of the stragglers round the skirts of the
Delaware camp: here the chief suddenly halted, and turning
towards Reginald, bent on him the full gaze of his dark and
lustrous eyes; the latter observed with surprise that their expression,
as well as that of his usually haughty features, was a
deep composed melancholy.</p>

<p>At length the Delaware broke the long and painful silence,
addressing his companion, after his imperfect notion of English,
in the following words:—</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit sent a cloud between Netis and War&ndash;Eagle—a
very black cloud; the lightning came from it and
blinded the eyes of the Lenapé chief, so that he looked on his
brother and thought he saw an enemy. The Bad Spirit whispered
in his ear that the tongue of Netis was forked; that the
heart of Olitipa was false; that she had listened to a mockingbird,
and had mingled for War&ndash;Eagle a cup of poison.”</p>

<p>The Delaware paused for a moment; his eye retained its
steady but sad expression, his lips were firmly compressed,
and not a muscle betrayed the intensity of his feeling; but
Reginald appreciated rightly the self&ndash;control that had conquered,
in so severe a struggle, and grasping his friend’s
hand, he said,—</p>

<p>“Noble and generous son of the Lenapé, the Bad Spirit
has no power over a heart like yours! Are we not brothers?
Have not the waters of the Muskingum, and the treacherous
knife of the Huron, tied our hearts together, so that no fear,
no suspicion, no falsehood, can come between them? Netis
believed that War&ndash;Eagle loved Olitipa only as a sister, or he
would rather have given his scalp to Mahéga than have spoken
soft words in the maiden’s ear!”</p>

<p>“My brother’s words are true,” replied the Delaware, in
the low and musical tone for which his voice was remarkable;
“War&ndash;Eagle knows it; he has dreamt, and is now awake:
Olitipa is his sister—the Great Spirit decrees that no child
of an Indian warrior shall call her mother. It is enough.”
The countenance of the Delaware assumed a sterner expression
as he continued:—</p>

<p>“My brother must be ready; let his rifle be loaded and his
eye open, for Tamenund has seen the snow of many winters;
the Black Father is good and true, but his hand knows not the
tomahawk: the Osage panther will crouch near the tent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Olitipa, and the feet of the Cut&ndash;throats<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> will not be far; before
the sun goes down War&ndash;Eagle will see his brother again.”</p>

<p>Thus saying, and waiting no reply, he returned with hearty
strides towards the village. Reginald gazed long and earnestly
after the retreating figure of the Indian, forgetting awhile, in
admiration of his heroic self&ndash;control, the dangers that beset his
beloved and his party.</p>

<p>“Could I,” he asked himself, “could I, under the same
circumstances, with all the light, and aid, and high motives of
Christianity, have shown the forbearance, generosity, and self&ndash;command
displayed by this noble heathen? Could I have seen
all my long&ndash;cherished hopes, my warm and passionate love,
blasted in a moment, and have so soon, so frankly, and so fully
exculpated and forgiven the man to whom I owed my misery?
I hope I might have done so, still I am afraid to ask my heart
the question!”</p>

<p>Reginald’s cheek glowed under the influence of this self&ndash;scrutiny,
and he gladly availed himself of the approach of
Paul Müller, to whom he related what had passed, and expressed
in the warmest terms his admiration of his Indian
brother’s conduct. The good missionary felt inexpressibly
relieved at hearing the amicable issue now announced to him,
for although he had never been made a confidant of War&ndash;Eagle’s
feelings towards Olitipa, his own observation had
shown him of late that they were not exactly fraternal, and he
had viewed with dread a rivalry between the two high&ndash;spirited
young men, at a crisis when the aid of both might be so
necessary to protect his fair pupil from the perils by which
she was surrounded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the machinations of Mahéga, which had been
conducted with his accustomed secrecy and cunning, were
almost ripe for execution; several runners had interchanged
communication between him and the Dahcotah chief, the latter
of whom was delighted at the prospect, thus unexpectedly
offered, of taking vengeance on his ancient and hated Lenapé
foes. A secret council of the Osages had been held, at which
a treaty with the Sioux and a rupture with the Delawares were
discussed, and almost unanimously carried, Mahéga appearing
rather to have coincided in the general determination than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
have caused it by his influence and intrigues. The result of
this council was, that the Osage village immediately struck
their lodges, the horses were driven in, skins, poultry, provisions,
and all their utensils were packed upon them, and in a
few hours the whole body moved in a north&ndash;easterly direction
towards the upper fork of the river Konzas.</p>

<p>While they were departing, the Delaware council was summoned
by a crier; Reginald and Baptiste were also invited to
attend, the former in compliment to his station in the tribe as
adopted brother of War&ndash;Eagle; the latter being recognised as
a warrior of tried courage and experience. The Chiefs and
Braves having seated themselves in a semicircle, the centre of
which was occupied by Tamenund, the Great Medicine pipe
was first passed round in silence, and with the accustomed
solemnities, after which Tamenund arose, and in a voice feeble
from age, but distinctly audible, proceeded to explain to the
assembly the affairs respecting which they had met to consult:
while he was speaking, one of the Indians appointed to guard
the entrance of the council lodge, came in and announced a
messenger from the Osage encampment. Tamenund paused,
and desired the messenger to be introduced.</p>

<p>All eyes were bent sternly on the envoy, who advanced
with a haughty and dignified step into the centre of the lodge,
where he stood still, and resting on a long lance which he held
in his right hand, awaited, according to Indian custom, a signal
from the council&ndash;chief to deliver his errand. His dress,
and the paint by which his body was adorned, had evidently
been prepared with every attention to the niceties of Indian
diplomacy, some portions of it being significant of peace or
alliance, and others of hostile preparation; his right side was
painted red, with streaks of black; on his left arm he wore a
round shield of buffalo&ndash;hide, a quiver of arrows hung at his
back, a tomahawk and knife were in his girdle, and in his left
hand he carried a large string of wampum<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, adorned with
sundry ribbons and thongs of party&ndash;coloured deer&ndash;skin.</p>

<p>The Delawares recognised in the messenger a young kinsman
of Mahéga, one who had already distinguished himself
by several feats of daring gallantry, and had been lately enrolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
among the braves of his nation: he had hitherto been
upon the most friendly terms with the Lenapé, was familiar
with their language, and had volunteered on more than one
occasion to follow War&ndash;Eagle on the war&ndash;path; but the lines
of paint and his accoutrements were now, as has before been
observed, so carefully selected, that their practised eyes were
unable to decide whether peace or war was the object of his
mission; neither was any inference to be drawn from his countenance
or bearing, for after the first cold salutation on entering,
he leaned on his lance in an attitude of haughty indifference.
Under these circumstances he was not invited to sit, neither
was the pipe handed to him, but Tamenund briefly addressed
him as follows:</p>

<p>“The messenger of the Osage may speak. The ears of the
Lenapé are open.”</p>

<p>“Flying&ndash;arrow,” replied the young man, in a modest and
quiet tone, “knows that many winters have passed over the
head of the Lenapé chief; he is sorry to speak hard words to
Tamenund.”</p>

<p>“Let the young warrior speak freely; Tamenund knows
that he is the mouth of the Osage council,” was the grave
reply.</p>

<p>“The Washashe say that the Lenapé have walked in a
crooked path. The council have assembled; and the words
delivered to Flying&ndash;arrow are these: The Washashe allowed
the Lenapé to kill meat on their hunting&ndash;ground, they smoked
the pipe together, and gave each other the wampum&ndash;belt of
peace; but the Lenapé hearts are white, though their skin is
red; their tongues are smooth with telling many lies: they
have brought the pale&ndash;faces here to aid them in driving the
Washashe from the hunting&ndash;fields of their fathers! Is it not
true?” continued the fearless envoy, in a louder strain; “they
have done all they can to throw dirt upon the lodges of those
whom they call brothers. When Mahéga offered to take the
daughter of Tamenund as his wife, what was said to him?
Does not the pale&ndash;face who crept upon him and defiled his
medicine, still sit and smoke at the Lenapé fire? Mahéga
says, let Tamenund give him Olitipa for a wife, and the pale&ndash;face,
called Netis, as a prisoner, and let him send back the
other white men to the Great River; then Mahéga will believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that the hearts of the Lenapé are true to the friendship pledged
on this belt.”</p>

<p>Thus saying, he shook the wampum before the assembled
Delawares with an air of proud defiance. A brief pause followed
this daring speech; the heart of War&ndash;Eagle boiled
within him, but a scornful smile sat upon his haughty countenance,
as he waited composedly for the reply of his father, who
seemed engaged in deep and serious meditation.</p>

<p>Reginald had, of course, been unable to follow the envoy’s
discourse, but his quick ear had detected his own name; and
a fierce look, which accompanied its pronunciation, told him
that he was personally interested in the object of the Osage’s
message. Having gathered from Baptiste, in a whisper, the
nature of Mahéga’s charge and demand, a flush of indignation
coloured his brow, but the examples of self&ndash;command that he
had so lately seen, and that he still witnessed in the iron features
by which he was surrounded, taught him to place a like
restraint upon his own feelings, and to await the reply of the
aged chief.</p>

<p>The latter, fixing his eye sternly upon the envoy, thus addressed
him: “Mahéga has filled the young brave’s mouth
with lies. The hearts of the Lenapé are true as the guiding&ndash;star.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
They are faithful to their friends, they fear no enemies.
Tamenund will not give Olitipa to Mahéga, nor his adopted
son to be the Washashe’s prisoner. Tamenund is old, but he
is not blind, Mahéga wishes to become a friend of the Dahcotahs.
It is well; he will find among them hearts as bad
and tongues as forked as his own! I have spoken.”</p>

<p>A deep murmur of approbation followed the aged chief’s
brief but energetic harangue, and as soon as it was concluded,
the fearless messenger drew a sharp knife from his girdle, and
severing the wampum&ndash;belt, he cast the two halves on the
ground, saying, “It is well! thus is the league between the
Washashe and the Lenapé divided.”</p>

<p>Baptiste, to whom Reginald had again addressed a few
words in a whisper, now rose, and having requested permission
of Tamenund, said to the Osage messenger, “Netis desires
you to tell Mahéga that he is a liar,—brave enough to frighten
women, but nothing more. If he is a warrior, let him come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
to&ndash;morrow at sunrise to the open prairie, north of the camp;
the friends of both shall stand back three arrow&ndash;flights apart;
Netis will meet him with a rifle and a hunting&ndash;knife; Olitipa
will not be there to save his life again!”</p>

<p>Another murmur of approbation went round the assembly,
many of whom had already heard of the rough treatment that
the gigantic Osage had received at Reginald’s hands, but hearing
it now confirmed by the lips of a tried warrior, like Grande&ndash;Hâche,
they looked with increased respect and esteem on the
adopted brother of War&ndash;Eagle.</p>

<p>“Flying&ndash;arrow will tell Mahéga,” was the brief reply; and
the messenger glancing his eye haughtily around the circle,
left the lodge and returned to the encampment of his tribe.
After his departure the council continued their deliberations
for some time, and had not yet concluded them when a distant
and repeated shouting attracted their attention, and a Delaware
youth, of about fifteen years of age, rushed into the lodge,
breathless, and bleeding from a wound inflicted by an arrow,
which had pierced his shoulder. A few hurried sentences
explained to the chiefs the news of which he was the bearer.
It appeared that he had been tending, in a bottom not far
distant, a herd of horses, chiefly belonging to Tamenund,
War&ndash;Eagle, and the party of white men, when a band of
mounted Sioux came sweeping down the valley at full speed;
two or three young Delawares, who formed the out&ndash;picquet
on that side, had been taken completely by surprise, and
paid with their lives the penalty of their carelessness.</p>

<p>The wounded youth who brought the intelligence had only
escaped by his extreme swiftness of foot, and by the unwillingness
of the enemy to approach too near the camp. Thus
had the Dahcotahs succeeded in carrying off, by a bold stroke,
upwards of one hundred of the best horses from the Delaware
village; and Reginald soon learnt, to his inexpressible
annoyance and regret, that Nekimi was among the number of
the captives. A hurried consultation followed, in which War&ndash;Eagle,
throwing off the modest reserve that he had practised
during the council, assumed his place as leader of the Lenapé
braves, of whom he selected forty of the most active and daring,
to accompany him on the difficult and dangerous expedition
that was to be instantly undertaken for the recovery of the
stolen horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Reginald and Baptiste eagerly volunteered, and were instantly
accepted by War&ndash;Eagle; but it was not without some
persuasion on the part of the guide, that the chief allowed
Monsieur Perrot to be of the party; that faithful valet insisted,
however, so obstinately upon his right to attend his
master, that, on Baptiste enjoining that he should implicitly
obey orders, he was permitted to form one of the selected band.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour, from the receipt of the above
disastrous intelligence, the party left the camp well armed and
equipped, each man carrying three pounds of dried buffalo
meat; and Baptiste secured twice that quantity to his sturdy
person, thinking it probable that Reginald’s endurance of hunger
might not prove proportionate to his active qualities. The
latter had, indeed, forgotten the meat altogether, for he passed
the last few minutes of his stay within the camp, in bidding
farewell to Prairie&ndash;bird, and in assuring her that he would
not be long absent, but trusted soon to return with his favourite
Nekimi. At his departure, Reginald left the strictest
orders with Bearskin (who remained in charge of his party)
to keep a faithful watch over the safety of Prairie&ndash;bird, and
to follow the injunctions that he might receive from Tamenund
and Paul Müller.</p>

<p>The small band, who, at the instigation of Mahéga, had
stolen the Delaware horses, were chosen warriors, well mounted,
thoroughly trained to the predatory warfare in which they were
now engaged, and ready, either to defend their prize against
an equal force, or to baffle the pursuit of a superior one. As
War&ndash;Eagle had lost many of his best horses, he resolved to
follow the enemy’s trail on foot, but he desired two or three of
his most active and enterprising followers, whose horses had
not been stolen, to hover on the rear of the retreating party,
to watch their motions, and bring back any intelligence that
might aid him in the pursuit.</p>

<p>The select band of Delawares moved swiftly forward under
the guidance of their young leader; close upon his steps followed
Reginald, burning with impatience to recover his favourite
steed; next to him came Baptiste, then Perrot, and the
remainder of the Lenapé warriors.</p>

<p>The prairie&ndash;grass trodden down by the hoofs of the galloping
and affrighted steeds driven from their pasture, afforded a trail
that could be traced without difficulty, and the trampled banks
of several slow and lazy streams, which they passed in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
course, marked the headlong course taken by their fugitive
steeds and their fierce drivers.</p>

<p>We will leave the pursuers for a time, and follow the movements
of Mahéga, who was now acting in concert with the
Sioux, and who contrived by his superior address to direct
their plans, as completely as if he had been himself the chief
of their tribe. Having accompanied the Osage village, fourteen
or fifteen miles on their route to the northward, he ordered
a halt by the side of a stream, in a valley adjacent to the encampment
of their new allies, the two bands forming a body
so superior in number to the Delawares, that they had no
cause to fear an attack, especially as they learnt from their
scouts that War&ndash;Eagle and his followers had gone in an opposite
direction in pursuit of the horse&ndash;stealing party.</p>

<p>The evening was dark, and favoured the execution of a plot
which Mahéga had formed, and in furtherance of which all
his preceding measures had been taken. As soon as the sun
had set, he selected one hundred of the bravest and most experienced
warriors in his tribe, whom he armed only with bow
and arrows, knife, and tomahawk; strictly forbidding the use
of any fire&ndash;arms; for he well knew that the latter were far
from being effective weapons in the hands of his followers,
especially in such an expedition as that in which he was engaged.
Swiftly and silently they moved under their leader’s
guidance, who, directing his course towards the south&ndash;east,
brought them, after a few hours’ march, to the line of wood
skirting the great Prairie. Aware that the warriors remaining
in the Delaware encampment would be prepared against any
surprise from the quarter in which the Sioux were posted, his
present object was to make his attack from the opposite side,
in order to effect which, undiscovered, the greatest skill and
rapidity were necessary.</p>

<p>It was on occasions such as these that the qualities of the
Osage chief were most conspicuously exhibited; with light and
noiseless step, he led his party through the depths of the forest,
and during a swift march of many hours not a word was
spoken; now and then he paused as a startled deer rustled
through the thicket, and once or twice, when a stray moonbeam,
forcing its way through the foliage, silvered the bark of the
sycamore, he cast his eye upwards, as if to learn from the
leaves the direction of the wind, or to scan the heaven in search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of one of those stars, which the imperfect, but sagacious astronomy
of the Indians teaches them to recognise as guides.</p>

<p>Leave we them to pursue their dark and circuitous path
and let us transport the reader to the interior of the Delaware
encampment, where (as it may be remembered) Bearskin was
left in command of that portion of the white men who had
not accompanied their leader in pursuit of the Sioux.</p>

<p>Paul Müller sat late at night in the tent of the Prairie&ndash;bird;
on the rude table lay the Bible from which he had been reading,
and explaining some difficulties that had perplexed her
strong, yet inquiring mind; afterwards they had turned the
conversation to the scenes which had occurred within the last
few days, and which were calculated to inspire serious anticipations
of coming evil. Prairie&ndash;bird made no effort to conceal
from her affectionate instructor how entirely her heart was
given to Reginald; she knew his bold and fearless disposition;
she knew too the wily cunning of the powerful tribe against
whom his expedition was undertaken, and more than one
heavy sigh escaped her when she thought of the risks that he
must incur.</p>

<p>The good missionary employed every possible argument to
allay her fears, but none so effectively as that which referred to
the protection of that Being who had been from childhood her
hope, her trust, and her shield, and, bidding her good night, he
had the pleasure of seeing her agitated spirit resume its usual
composure. He then wrapped his cloak round his shoulders,
and went out to see what provision Bearskin had made for the
security of the camp, during the absence of Reginald, War&ndash;Eagle,
and their party. The rough old boatman was smoking
his pipe over the embers of a fire in front of the lodge where
he slept; beside him lay, half&ndash;asleep, the gigantic Mike Smith;
and the other white men were within the lodge, each having
his rifle within reach, and his knife and pistols in his belt.
Bearskin returned the greeting of the missionary with blunt
civility, and informed him that he had been to the lodge of
Tamenund, where it had been agreed to throw forward an
outpost of a dozen light, active, young Indians, half a mile beyond
the camp, in the direction of the Sioux: runners had
also been sent round to desire the warriors to be ready, and all
the usual precautions taken, such as are observed by Indians
in the neighbourhood of a dangerous enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Satisfied with these arrangements, Paul Müller returned to
his tent, and throwing himself on the pile of buffalo skins
that formed his bed, was soon fast asleep. He knew not how
long he had slept, when he was aroused by a cry such as none
who has once heard it can mistake or forget. Scarcely had
that shrill and savage whoop pierced the dull silence of the
night, when every creature within the encampment sprang to
their feet; the braves and warriors, seizing their weapons,
rushed to the quarter whence the cry proceeded, while the
women and children, crowding round the aged and defenceless
men, waited in suspense the result of the sudden and fierce
attack. The noise and the tumult came from the northern
quarter, that most remote from the lodges of Tamenund and
Prairie&ndash;bird. Sixty of the chosen Osage warriors had fallen
upon the small outpost placed to give the alarm, and, driving
them easily before them and killing some, entered the camp
almost simultaneously with the survivors. This band was led
by that daring young warrior before introduced to the reader
under the name of Flying&ndash;arrow, who now burned with desire
to render his name in the war annals of his tribe famous as
that of his kinsman Mahéga. Nor were the Delaware warriors
slow to meet the invaders, with a courage equal to their own;
the conflict was fierce and confused, for the moon was no longer
up, and the pale stars were contending, in a cloudy sky, with
the dim grey hue that precedes the dawn of day, so that the
dusky figures of the combatants were scarcely visible, and by
their voices alone could they distinguish friends from foes.</p>

<p>At the first alarm, Bearskin, with his habitual coolness,
ordered Mike Smith, with three of his men, to retire into the
rear, to assist in protecting the lodge of Tamenund and the
tent of Prairie&ndash;bird, while he led the remainder to check
the advance of the Osages from the northward. For some
time the latter seemed to be gaining ground, but the Delawares,
still superior in number and hastening to the spot, aided by
Bearskin and his followers, recovered their lost advantage, and
the combat raged with renewed fury.</p>

<p>At this crisis Mahéga, who had succeeded in gaining, unperceived,
the valley to the southward of the Delaware camp,
fell upon their rear with his reserve of forty men; overthrowing
all who opposed him, he forced his way towards the white
tent, which the advancing light of dawn rendered now easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
distinguishable from the dark&ndash;coloured lodges around it;
shouting his battle&ndash;cry with a voice like a trumpet, he rushed
onward, caring not, apparently, for scalps or trophies, but determined
on securing the prize for which he had already
broken his faith, and imbrued his hands in the blood of allies
who had done him no injury. A gallant band of Delawares
surrounded their aged chief, whose trembling hand now grasped
a tomahawk that had for twenty years reposed idly in his belt.
Prairie&ndash;bird had sprung from her couch, and already joined in
the brief, but earnest prayer, which Paul Müller breathed at
her side; he recognised the Osage war&ndash;cry, and divining the
chief object of their terrible leader, he whispered solemnly to
her,—</p>

<p>“My dear child, if I am soon taken from you, keep, nevertheless,
your trust in God. I see that knife still in your girdle;
I know what you have once dared; if it be the will of Heaven,
you must be prepared patiently to endure pain, sorrow, confinement,
or oppression; remember, it is only as the last resource
against dishonour, that you may have recourse to it.”</p>

<p>The maiden replied not, but a glance from her dark
eye assured him that he was understood, and would be obeyed;
many emotions contended in her bosom, but, for the moment,
reverence and attachment to her affectionate instructor prevailed
over all others, and, dropping on her knees before him,
she covered his hand with kisses, saying,</p>

<p>“Dear Father, if we must be separated, bless, bless your
grateful child.”</p>

<p>The worthy missionary, albeit accustomed to resign himself
entirely to the will of Heaven, could scarcely command himself
sufficiently to utter aloud the blessing that he implored upon
her head; but the shouts and cries of the combatants were
every moment approaching nearer, and seizing his staff, he
went to the aperture in front of the lodge, in order to ascertain
how the tide of conflict was turning.</p>

<p>The first object that met his view was the aged Tamenund,
who had fallen in his hurried endeavour to rush to the combat,
but was now partly supported and partly detained by his
wailing wives and daughters, while the tomahawk that had
dropped from his nerveless arm lay upon the ground beside
him. As soon as he saw Paul Müller, he called him, and said,
in a low voice,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“The breath of Tamenund is going; he has lived long
enough; the voices of his fathers are calling to him from the
far hunting&ndash;fields; he will go, and pray the Great Spirit to
give the scalps of these snake&ndash;tongued Washashe to the knife
of War&ndash;Eagle.” After a moment’s pause, the old man continued:
“I know that the heart of the Black Father is good
to the Lenapé; he has been a friend of many days to the lodge
of Tamenund; he must be a father to Olitipa; she is a sweet&ndash;scented
flower; the Great Spirit has given rain and sunshine
to nourish its growth, and its roots are deep in Tamenund’s
heart; the Black Father will not allow it to be trodden under
the feet of Mahéga.” While saying these words he drew from
under his blanket a small leathern bag, the neck of which was
carefully closed with ligaments of deer sinew that had been
dipped in wax, or some similarly adhesive substance. “This,”
he added, “is the medicine&ndash;bag of Olitipa; the Black Father
must keep it when Tamenund is gone, and, while it is safe,
the steps of the Bad Spirit will not draw near her.”</p>

<p>The missionary took the bag and concealed it immediately
under his vest, but, before he had time to reply to his aged
friend, a terrific cry announced that the Osages had succeeded
in breaking through the Delaware ranks, and a fearful scene of
confusion, plunder, and massacre ensued; the faithful missionary
hastened to the side of his trembling pupil, resolved
to die in defending her from injury, while the air was rent
by the shouts of the victors, and the yells and shrieks of those
suffering under their relentless fury.</p>

<p>Mike Smith and his men plied their weapons with determined
courage and resolution, and several of the Osages paid
with their lives the forfeit of their daring attack; still the survivors
pressed forward, bearing back the white men by force
of numbers, and allowing not a moment for the reloading of
the fire&ndash;arms. The voice of Mahéga rose high above the surrounding
din, and all seemed to shrink from the terrible weapon
which he wielded as if it had been a light cane or small&ndash;sword;
it was a short bludgeon, headed with a solid ball of iron, from
which protruded several sharp iron spikes, already red with
human blood. Mike Smith came boldly forward to meet him,
holding in his left hand a discharged horse&ndash;pistol, and in his
right a heavy cutlass, with which last he made a furious
cut at the advancing Osage. The wary chief neither received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
nor parried it, but, springing lightly aside, seized the same
moment for driving his heavy mace full on the unguarded
forehead of his opponent, and the unfortunate woodsman
dropped like an ox felled at the shambles; the fierce Indian,
leaping forward, passed his knife twice through the prostrate
body, and tearing off the scalp, waved the bloody trophy over
his head.</p>

<p>Disheartened by the fall of their brave and powerful companion,
the remaining white men offered but a feeble resistance,
and the Osage chief rushed onwards to the spot where
only some wounded Delawares and a few devoted and half&ndash;armed
youths were gathered around the aged Tamenund, determined
to die at his side. It is not necessary to pursue the
sickening details of the narrative.</p>

<p>The old man received his death&ndash;blow with a composed
dignity worthy of his race, and his faithful followers met
their fate with equal heroism, neither expecting nor receiving
mercy.</p>

<p>The victory was now complete, and both the scattered
Delawares and the remaining white men fled for shelter and
safety to the nearest points in the dense line of forest; few, if
any, would have reached it, had not the war&ndash;pipe of Mahéga
called his warriors around him. None dared to disobey the
signal, and in a few minutes they stood before him in front
of the tent within which the faithful missionary still cheered
and supported his beloved pupil. The fierce Osage, counting
over his followers, found that fifteen were killed or mortally
wounded: but the loss on the part of their opponents was much
heavier, without reckoning upwards of a score prisoners, whose
hands and legs were tightly fastened with bands of withy and
elm&ndash;bark.</p>

<p>Mahéga, putting his head into the aperture of the tent,
ordered Paul Müller to come forth.</p>

<p>“Resistance is unavailing,” whispered the missionary to
the weeping girl; “it will be harder with thee if I obey not
this cruel man. Practise now, dear child, the lessons that we
have so often read together, and leave the issue to Him who
has promised never to leave nor forsake those who trust in
Him.”</p>

<p>So saying, he kissed her forehead, and gently disengaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
himself from the hand that still clung to his garment, he went
forth from the tent, and stood before Mahéga.</p>

<p>That wily chief was well aware that both the missionary
and his fair pupil had many warm friends among his own
tribe; there was in fact scarcely a family among them that had
not experienced from one, or both, some act of charity or kindness;
he had resolved therefore to treat them without severity,
and while he assured himself of the person of Olitipa, to send
her instructor to some distant spot, where neither his advice
nor his reproofs were to be feared; with this determination he
addressed him briefly, as follows:—</p>

<p>“The Black Father will travel with my young men towards
the east; he is no longer wanted here; he may seek the lodges
of the Lenapé squaws beyond the Great River; he may advise
them to remain where they are, to dig and grow corn, and not
to come near the hunting fields of the Washashe. My young
men will travel three days with him; they may meet
strangers,—if he is silent, his life is safe; if he speaks, their
tomahawk drinks his blood; when they have left him, his
tongue and his feet are free. I have spoken.”</p>

<p>Mahéga added a few words in a lower tone to the young
warrior who was to execute his orders, and who, with two
others, now stood by his prisoner; there was a lowering frown
on the brow of the chief, and a deep meaning in his tone,
showing plainly that there would be danger in disobeying the
letter of those commands.</p>

<p>Paul Müller, advancing a few steps, addressed the chief in
the Delaware tongue, with which he knew him to be familiar.
“Mahéga is a great chief, and the Black Father is weak, and
must obey him; before he goes he will speak some words
which the chief must lock up in his heart. He loves Olitipa;
he wishes to make her his wife; it may be, after a season,
that she may look kindly upon him; but she is not like other
maidens, she is under the care of the Great Spirit. Mahéga
is strong, but her medicine is stronger. She can hide the
moon behind a cloud, and gather the fire of the sun as the
daughters of the Washashe gather the river&ndash;waters in a vessel;
let the chief remember the Black Father’s last words. If
Mahéga protects Olitipa and what belongs to her in the tent,
it may be better for him when the Great Spirit is angry; if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
offers her harm or insult, he will die like a dog, and wolves
will pick his bones.”</p>

<p>The missionary delivered this warning with a dignity and
solemnity so earnest, that the eye of the fierce but superstitious
savage quailed before him; and pleased to mark the effect of
his words, Paul Müller turned and left the spot, muttering in
his own tongue to himself, “God will doubtless forgive my
endeavour to protect, through this artifice, a forlorn and friendless
maiden, left in the hands of a man so cruel and unscrupulous.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the good missionary had completed the
slight preparation requisite for his journey, and, accompanied
by his Indian escort, left the ruined and despoiled village with
a heavy heart.</p>

<p>As soon as Mahéga was somewhat recovered from the
startling effect of Paul Müller’s parting address, he made his
dispositions for the further movements of his band with his
usual rapidity and decision; he was well aware that his position
was now one of great peril, that in a short time War&ndash;Eagle
and his party would be informed of all that had passed,
and would seek a bloody revenge; he knew also that some of
the fugitive Whites or Delawares might speedily arm a body
of the inhabitants of the frontier against him, and that he
would be altogether unable to maintain himself in the region
that he now occupied.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances he made up his own mind as to
the course that he would pursue; and having first given all
the necessary orders for the burial of the Osage dead and the
care of the wounded, as well as for the security of the prisoners,
he called together the heads of his party, and having
laid before them his plans, asked their advice with a tone and
manner probably resembling that with which, a few years
later, Napoleon was in the habit of asking the counsel of his
generals and captains; a tone indicating that his course being
already determined, nothing was expected of them but compliance.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">WAR&ndash;EAGLE AND REGINALD, WITH THEIR PARTY, PURSUE THE
DAHCOTAHS.</p>

<p class="pn">We left Reginald, and War&ndash;Eagle’s party, in pursuit of the
marauding band of Sioux horse&ndash;stealers. They continued their
toilsome march with unabated speed until nightfall, when the
trail was no longer distinguishable: they then halted, and
while they ate a scanty supper, the mounted Delawares, who
had been sent forward, returned, bringing with them two
wearied horses which had escaped, in the hurried flight, from
their captors.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle, summoning Baptiste to his side, questioned the
young man closely as to the appearance and direction of the
trail. From their answers he learnt that its course was northward,
but that it bore gradually towards the east, especially
after a brief halt, which the Sioux had made for refreshment;
a gleam shot athwart the dusky features of the young chief at
this intelligence, but he made no observation, and contented
himself with asking the opinion of his more experienced
companion.</p>

<p>The guide, taking off his hunting&ndash;cap, allowed the evening
breeze to play through the grisly hairs which were scattered,
not too plentifully, on his weather&ndash;beaten forehead, as if his
reflective powers might thence derive refreshment; but, apparently,
the expedient was not, at least on this occasion, rewarded
with success; for, after meditating in silence for a few
seconds, he shook his head and owned that he saw no clue to the
intentions of the party whom they were pursuing. The young
chief had his eye still bent upon the ground, seemingly employed
in observing a large rent, which the day’s march had
made in his mocassin; but the woodsman read in the lines of
his intelligent countenance that the mind was busily engaged
in following a connected train of thought.</p>

<p>After allowing a few minutes to pass in silence, the guide,
addressing his companion, said, “Can War&ndash;Eagle see the
Dahcotah path? It is hid from the eyes of Grande&ndash;Hàche.”</p>

<p>“The night is dark, and the eyes cannot see the trail; but
the wolf finds his way to the wounded bison, and the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
dove keeps her course to her nest in the mountain. The Great
Spirit has not made the Lenapé warrior more ignorant than
the bird, or the brute; War&ndash;Eagle knows the path of the
Dahcotah dogs.” He then bent down towards the ear of
Baptiste, and whispered to him long and earnestly in the
Delaware tongue.</p>

<p>“Capote&ndash;bleu! but the boy is right,” exclaimed the guide,
in his own mixed dialect; “the dogs have only taken this
northern start to mislead us; they are not making for the
Missouri river, but intend to double back and join their village,
now lying to the eastward of us. The boy is right; my
brain must be getting as worn&ndash;out as my hunting&ndash;shirt, or I
should have understood their drift. I see his plan is to be in
cash<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> for them on their return. Well, if he can make sure
of his game, I will say that he’s fit to be a war&ndash;chief, for
these Sioux have a long start, and the village must be many
miles to the right.”</p>

<p>As he made these reflections half aloud, Reginald caught
their general bearing; and though he had great confidence in
the sagacity of his Indian friend, still he felt a chill of disappointment
at the idea that the pursuit was to be abandoned,
for what appeared to him the hopeless chance of intercepting
a small band of Sioux, of whose course they were ignorant, in
a boundless extent of prairie like that around him. He had,
however, good sense enough to conceal all traces of his disappointment,
knowing that on such an expedition there can be
but one leader, and that, without unanimity and discipline,
failure must ensue.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle now called one of the young Lenapé warriors
to his side, and gave him brief instructions, to the effect, that
he was to choose three others of the best runners of the
party, and, accompanied by the mounted Indians, to start with
the earliest dawn on the Dahcotah trail, which they were to
follow as close as possible without discovering themselves. He
then desired Reginald and Baptiste to divide the band into
watches, and to sleep alternately, but not to move until he
returned.</p>

<p>Having given these few directions, without allowing himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
either food or rest after a march of so many hours, he drew
his belt tighter around his loins, and started on his solitary
excursion. Reginald watched the retreating figure of his
friend, until it was lost in the deepening gloom, and turning
to the guide, he said,—</p>

<p>“Baptiste, I cannot but envy War&ndash;Eagle the possession of
sinews that seem unconscious of fatigue, and eyes that require
no slumber! We have marched from daylight until this late
hour without either rest or refreshment, and I confess I am
very glad of this seat on my buffalo&ndash;robe, and this slice of
dried venison, with a draught of water; War&ndash;Eagle, however,
walks off into the prairie, as if he had just started fresh from
repose, and Heaven only knows where or for what purpose
he is going.”</p>

<p>“Master Reginald,” replied the guide, throwing himself
lazily down by the side of his young leader; “I will not
deny that War&ndash;Eagle’s sinews are strung like the bow of a
Pawnee, for I have been on a trail with him before, and few
could follow it so long or so true; but there has been a time,”
he added, casting his eyes down on his worn and soiled
leggins, “when these limbs of mine would have kept me for a
week at the heels of the fleetest Dahcotah that ever crossed
the country of the Stone&ndash;eaters.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Those days are gone, but
when the game’s afoot, perhaps there may be younger men
who might give out before old Baptiste yet.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the eye of the guide rested with a comic grin
on Monsieur Perrot, who, with a countenance somewhat rueful,
was endeavouring to masticate a crude pomme de prairie<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
that one of the Delawares had given to him, with the assurance
that it was “very good!”</p>

<p>“I believe you, Baptiste,” said Reginald, humouring the
old hunter’s pardonable vanity; “I believe you, indeed, and
if the Sioux offer us a long chase, as appears likely, the crack
of your rifle will be heard before the foremost of our party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
has come to close quarters with them; but you have not
answered my question relative to War&ndash;Eagle’s excursion during
this dark night.”</p>

<p>“He is gone,” replied the guide, “to examine the ground
carefully, perhaps even to approach the northern border of the
Dahcotah encampment; he will then judge of the route by which
these horse&ndash;stealing vagabonds are likely to return, and will
choose a place for us to conceal ourselves for an attack.”</p>

<p>“I understand it all, Baptiste; it seems to be a bold, well&ndash;devised
plan, if War&ndash;Eagle is only correct in his guess at
their intentions: meanwhile let us post our sentries, and get
what sleep we can, for to&ndash;morrow may be a busy day.”</p>

<p>They accordingly divided their party into watches, Baptiste
and Perrot with one Indian taking the first, and Reginald
undertaking the charge of the second. The night was gloomy,
and few stars were visible through the thick clouds, by which
the heavens were overspread; the men were partially sheltered
by some stunted alder&ndash;bushes which grew by the side of the
stream with whose waters they had cooled their thirst, and
those who were not destined to the first watch soon fell asleep,
lulled by the distant howling of a hungry pack of prairie&ndash;wolves.</p>

<p>Towards the close of Reginald’s watch, about an hour before
daybreak, a dusky figure glided with noiseless step towards the
encampment; the young man cocked his rifle, in order to be
prepared against surprise, but in the next moment recognised
the commanding form of his friend, and hailed him by name.</p>

<p>“Netis!” replied the chief, sitting down beside him, and
wringing the water from his leggins, which had been saturated
partly by the heavy dew on the long grass through which he
had made his way, and partly by the streams which he had
been obliged to ford.</p>

<p>“Has my brother found a path?” inquired Reginald in a
whisper; “has he been near the Dahcotah village?”</p>

<p>“He has,” replied the chief; “he has seen their lodges.”</p>

<p>“Can my brother find the path by which the horse&ndash;stealers
will return!”</p>

<p>“He can guess, he cannot be sure,” replied the young Indian,
modestly.</p>

<p>Here the conversation closed, and in a few minutes the little
party were aroused and afoot, their leader being resolved that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
not a moment should be lost, as soon as there was sufficient
light for pursuing the trail.</p>

<p>When on the point of starting, Baptiste, taking War&ndash;Eagle
aside, whispered in his ear a few words, on which the latter
appeared to reflect seriously and somewhat in doubt: he nodded
his head, however, and replied, “Well, it is good.”</p>

<p>The guide informed Reginald that at his own request he was
to accompany the party on the trail.</p>

<p>“You see, Master Reginald,” he continued, “I am a true&ndash;scented
old hound, and if these young ones run too fast, I may
perhaps help ‘em at a pinch; then if we catch the scoundrels,
you will be in their front, and we in their rear, and they will
be as bad off as a Kentucky coon between two of old Dan
Boone’s cur dogs. Remember the signals,” he added impressively,
touching the bugle slung across his shoulder. “We have
not practised them of late, but I have forgot none of them;
they may do us a good turn here; stick close to War&ndash;Eagle,
you are sworn brothers, and, according to Indian fashion, if he
falls you must die with him or revenge him.”</p>

<p>“That will I, honest Baptiste,” replied our hero; “the
Lenapé shall not say that their chief was deserted by his
adopted brother; neither will I forget the signals—farewell!”</p>

<p>Here the two parties separated, that of Baptiste resuming
their pursuit of the trail, and that of War&ndash;Eagle following in
silence the rapid strides of their young chief across the prairie
to the eastward. He marched for several hours in silence—his
brow wore an expression of thoughtfulness, and he stopped
several times as if to scan the bearing and the distance of every
remarkable elevation or object in the undulating prairie which
they were crossing. It was now about midday; they had
walked since daybreak without halt or food; the rays of the sun
were fiercely hot, and it required all the determined energy of
Reginald’s character to enable him to endure in silence the
heat and thirst by which he was oppressed; as for Monsieur
Perrot, he had contrived to secrete a small flask of brandy
about his person, more than one mouthful of which, mingled
with the muddy water of the pools which they passed, had
hitherto enabled him to keep pace with the rest of the party,
but he was now beginning to lag behind, and some of the
Indians were obliged to urge and assist him forward.</p>

<p>At this juncture War&ndash;Eagle suddenly stopped, and uttering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
a sound like a low hiss, crouched upon the ground, an attitude
into which the whole party sunk in a moment. Laying a
finger lightly on Reginald’s arm, he pointed to the upper range
of a distant hill, saying, “There are men!” Our hero, shading
his eyes with his hand, looked in the direction indicated,
but, after a careful survey, he could see nothing but the faint
green reposing in the sunny haze of noon: he shook his head;
but War&ndash;Eagle replied with a quiet smile—</p>

<p>“My brother saw the rifles behind the log near the Muskingham;
his eyes are very true, but they have not looked
much at the prairie; let him use his medicine glass&ndash;pipe.”</p>

<p>When Reginald had adjusted his telescope, he looked again
to the spot on which the bright clear eye of War&ndash;Eagle was
still riveted like the gaze of a Highland deer&ndash;hound, who has
caught sight of a hart browsing on the further side of some
wide and rocky glen.</p>

<p>“By Heaven, it is true!” he exclaimed. “I see them—one,
two, three, mounted Indians; they are at speed—and buffalo
are galloping before them.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” said War&ndash;Eagle; “keep the glass&ndash;pipe
before them, and say if they go out of sight, or if more
appear.”</p>

<p>Reginald did so; and after a few minutes, reported that
they had disappeared over a neighbouring height, and that no
others had come in view.</p>

<p>Upon this, War&ndash;Eagle rose, saying, “My brother shall
drink and rest—there are shade and water not far.” As he
had said, half an hour’s march brought them to a clump of
stunted alders, beside which flowed a stream, the waters of
which were tolerably fresh and cool. Here they ate some
dried buffalo&ndash;meat, and satisfied their thirst, after which they
followed with renewed spirits their gay leader, whose iron and
sinewy frame seemed (like that of Antæus of old) to gather
fresh strength every time that his foot fell upon the earth. The
prairie through which they now passed was extremely hilly
and broken, intersected by many steep and narrow ravines;
threading his way among these, the chief frequently stopped
to examine the foot&ndash;marks which had been left by bison or
other animals, and often bent his searching glance along the
sides of the hills around him. The only living creatures seen
during the whole march were a few bulls, lazily cropping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
prairie grass, as if conscious that their tough carcase, and
burnt, soiled hides, rendered them at this season worthless
to the hunters, who had driven from them the cows and
the younger bulls of the herd. Emerging from these defiles,
the party came to a broader valley, the sides of which were
very steep; along the bottom ran a stream of considerable
magnitude, on the banks of which was a large tract of copse&ndash;wood,
consisting apparently of alder, poplar, and birch, and
affording ample space for concealing a body of several hundred
men.</p>

<p>Towards this wood War&ndash;Eagle led the way; and when he
reached a few bushes, distant from it some hundred yards, he
desired the rest of the party to lie still, while he went forward
alone to explore. During his absence Reginald occupied himself
with examining through his glass the sides of the valley,
but could see neither man nor any other living creature; and
when War&ndash;Eagle returned and conducted them into the wood,
Reginald could read on his friend’s countenance that he was
in high spirits at having reached this point undiscovered.</p>

<p>When they came to the centre of the woodland, they found
a broad trail, near which they were carefully posted by their
chief, in such a manner that, themselves unseen, they could
command a view of any one passing along it.</p>

<p>The party led by Baptiste was not less successful in carrying
out the instructions given to them by War&ndash;Eagle. After a
rapid and toilsome march of many hours upon the Dahcotah
trail, they came at length in sight of their enemies; although
at a distance of many miles, the prudence and caution of the
experienced scout controlled the impetuous ardour of the
young Delawares, who were burning to revenge the insult
offered to their tribe. But Baptiste was aware that to attack
with his present force would be hopeless, and he bent all his
energies to creep as near to the Sioux as possible, so that he
might be ready to dash in upon their rear, in case he should
find that the ambuscade of War&ndash;Eagle was successfully laid;
at the same time the hardy woodsman was determined not to
allow them, under any circumstances, to gain the village without
making by day or by night one bold effort for the recovery
of the horses.</p>

<p>A habit of self&ndash;control was one of the distinguishing features
of the guide’s character; and although his hatred of the Sioux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
was fierce and intense, as we have seen in the earlier part of
this tale, he now conducted his operations with a cool deliberation
that might almost have been mistaken for indifference:
selecting the most intelligent warrior among the Lenapé, he
sent him forward to creep on the trail; he himself followed at
a short distance; then the other runners at short intervals, and
the mounted Indians were desired to keep entirely out of sight
in the rear. In this order they continued the pursuit; and by
the skilful selection of ground, and taking advantage of every
trifling hill or ravine over which they passed, he contrived at
length to approach as near as he deemed it prudent to venture
until he should see the result of the stratagem devised by War&ndash;Eagle.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">A DESERTED VILLAGE IN THE WEST.—MAHÉGA CARRIES OFF PRAIRIE&ndash;BIRD,
AND ENDEAVOURS TO BAFFLE PURSUIT.</p>

<p class="pn">We must now shift the scene to the spot where the Delaware
village had been encamped. What a change had a few days
produced! The lodges of the chiefs, with their triangular
poles bearing their shields and trophies; the white tent of
Prairie&ndash;bird; the busy crowds of women and children; the
troops of horses, the songs and dances of the warriors—all
were gone! and in their stead nothing was to be seen but a
flock of buzzards, gorging themselves on a meal too revolting
to be described, and a pack of wolves snarling and quarrelling
over the remains of the unfortunate Lenapé victims.</p>

<p>On the very spot where the tent of Olitipa had been pitched,
and where the marks of the tent&ndash;poles were still easily recognised,
stood a solitary Indian, in an attitude of deep musing;
his ornamented hunting&ndash;shirt and leggins proclaimed his chieftain
rank; the rifle on which he leaned was of the newest and
best workmanship, and his whole appearance was singularly
striking; but the countenance was that which would have
riveted the attention of a spectator, had any been there to look
upon it, for it blended in its gentle yet proud lineaments a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
delicate beauty almost feminine, with a high heroic sternness,
that one could scarcely have thought it possible to find in a
youth only just emerging from boyhood: there was too a deep
silent expression of grief, rendered yet more touching by the
fortitude with which it was controlled and repressed. Drear
and desolate as was the scene around, the desolation of that
young heart was yet greater: father, brother, friend! the beloved
sister, the affectionate instructor; worst of all, the tribe,
the ancient people of whose chiefs he was the youngest and
last surviving scion, all swept away at “one fell swoop!”
And yet no tear fell from his eye, no murmur escaped his lip,
and the energies of that heroic though youthful spirit rose above
the tempest, whose fearful ravages he now contemplated with
stern and gloomy resolution.</p>

<p>In this sketch the reader will recognise Wingenund, who
had been absent, as was mentioned in a former chapter, on a
course of watching and fasting, preparatory to his being enrolled
among the band of warriors, according to the usages of
his nation. Had he been in the camp when the attack of the
Osages was made, there is little doubt that his last drop of
blood would have there been shed before the lodge of Tamenund;
but he had retired to a distance, whence the war&ndash;cry
and the tumult of the fight never reached his ear, and had
concluded his self&ndash;denying probation with a dream of happy
omen—a dream that promised future glory, dear to every ambitious
Indian spirit, and in which the triumphs of war were
wildly and confusedly blended with the sisterly tones of Olitipa’s
voice, and the sweet smile of the Lily of Mooshanne.</p>

<p>Inspired by his vision, the ardent boy returned in high hope
and spirits towards the encampment; but when he gained the
summit of a hill which overlooked it, a single glance sufficed
to show him the destruction that had been wrought during his
absence; he saw that the lodges were overthrown, the horses
driven off, and that the inhabitants of the moving village were
either dispersed or destroyed. Rooted to the spot, he looked
on the scene in speechless horror, when all at once his attention
was caught by a body of men moving over a distant height
in the western horizon, their figures being rendered visible by
the deep red background afforded by the setting sun: swift as
thought the youth darted off in pursuit.</p>

<p>After the shades of night had fallen, the retreating party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
halted, posted their sentries, lit their camp&ndash;fires, and, knowing
that nothing was to be feared from an enemy so lately and so
totally overthrown, they cooked their meat and their maize,
and smoked their pipes, with the lazy indifference habitual to
Indian warriors when the excitement of the chase or the fight
has subsided. In the centre of the camp rose a white tent,
and beside it a kind of temporary arbour had been hastily constructed
from reeds and alder&ndash;boughs; beneath the latter reclined
the gigantic form of Mahéga, stretched at his length,
and puffing out volumes of <i>kinnekenik</i><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> smoke with the self&ndash;satisfied
complacency of success.</p>

<p>Within the tent sat Prairie&ndash;bird, her eyes meekly raised to
heaven, her hands crossed upon her bosom, and a small basket
of corn&ndash;cakes being placed, untasted, upon the ground beside
her. At a little distance, in the corner of the tent, sate her
female Indian attendant, whom Mahéga had permitted, with a
delicacy and consideration scarcely to be expected from him,
to share her mistress’s captivity. He had also given orders
that all the lighter articles belonging to her toilet, and to the
furniture of her tent, should be conveyed with the latter, so
that as yet both her privacy and her comfort had been faithfully
secured.</p>

<p>Guided by the fires, Wingenund, who had followed with
unabated speed, had no difficulty in finding the Osage encampment;
neither was his intelligent mind at a loss to apprehend
what had occurred: he had long known the views and plans
entertained by Mahéga respecting Prairie&ndash;bird, and when, from
a distant eminence he caught a sight of her white tent pitched
in the centre of a retreating Indian band, he understood in a
moment her present situation, and the disastrous events that
had preceded it. Although he believed that both War&ndash;Eagle
and Reginald must have fallen ere his sister had been made a
captive, he resolved at all hazards to communicate with her,
and either to rescue her, or die in the attempt.</p>

<p>Having been so long encamped with the Osages, he was
tolerably well versed in their language; and he also knew so
well the general disposition of their outposts, that he had no
doubt of being able to steal into their camp. As soon as he
had gained, undiscovered, the shelter of a clump of alders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
only a few bow&ndash;shots distant from the nearest fire, he stripped
off and concealed his hunting&ndash;shirt, cap, leggins, and other
accoutrements, retaining only his belt, in which he hid a small
pocket&ndash;pistol, lately given to him by Reginald, and his scalp&ndash;knife,
sheathed in a case of bison&ndash;hide. Thus slightly armed,
he threw himself upon the grass, and commenced creeping
like a serpent towards the Osage encampment.</p>

<p>Unlike the sentries of civilised armies, those of the North
American Indians frequently sit at their appointed station, and
trust to their extraordinary quickness of sight and hearing to
guard them against surprise. Ere he had crept many yards,
Wingenund found himself near an Indian, seated with his
back against the decayed stump of a tree, and whiling away
his watch by humming a low and melancholy Osage air;
fortunately, the night was dark, and the heavy dew had so
softened the grass, that the boy’s pliant and elastic form wound
its onward way without the slightest noise being made to alarm
the lazy sentinel. Having passed this outpost in safety, he
continued his snaky progress, occasionally raising his head to
glance his quick eye around and observe the nature of the
obstacles that he had yet to encounter: these were less than
he expected, and he contrived at length to trail himself to the
back of Olitipa’s tent, where he ensconced himself unperceived
under cover of a large buffalo&ndash;skin, which was loosely thrown
over her saddle, to protect it from the weather. His first
object was to scoop out a few inches of the turf below the
edge of the tent, in order that he might conveniently hear or
be heard by her, without raising his voice above the lowest
whisper.</p>

<p>After listening attentively for a few minutes, a gentle and
regular breathing informed him that one sleeper was within;
but Wingenund, whose sharp eyes had already observed that
there were two saddles under the buffalo robe which covered
him, conjectured that her attendant was now her companion
in captivity, and that the grief and anxiety of Olitipa had
probably banished slumber from her eyes. To resolve these
doubts, and to effect the purpose of his dangerous attempt, he
now applied his mouth to the small opening that he had made
at the back of the tent, and gave a low and almost inaudible
sound from his lips like the chirping of a cricket. Low as it
was, the sound escaped not the quick ear of Olitipa, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
turned and listened more intently: again it was repeated, and
the maiden felt a sudden tremor of anxiety pervade her whole
frame, as from an instinctive consciousness that the sound
was a signal intended for her ear.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of the lodge were stretched the bulky
forms of two half&ndash;slumbering Osages. She knew that the
dreaded Mahéga was only a few paces distant, and that if
some friend were indeed near, the least indiscretion on her
part might draw down upon him certain destruction; but she
was courageous by nature, and habit had given her presence of
mind. Being aware that few, if any, of her captors spoke the
English tongue, she said, in a low but distinct voice, “If a
friend is near, let me hear the signal again?”</p>

<p>Immediately the cricket&ndash;chirrup was repeated. Convinced
now beyond a doubt that friendly succour was nigh, the
maiden’s heart throbbed with hope, fear, and many contending
emotions; but she lost not her self&ndash;possession; and having
now ascertained the spot whence the sound proceeded, she
moved the skins which formed her couch to that part of the
tent, and was thus enabled to rest her head within a few inches
of the opening made by Wingenund below the canvass.</p>

<p>“Prairie&ndash;bird,” whispered a soft voice, close to her ear—a
voice that she had a thousand times taught to pronounce her
name, and every accent of which was familiar to her ear.</p>

<p>“My brother!” was the low&ndash;breathed reply.</p>

<p>“If the Washashee do not hear, let my sister tell all, in
few words.”</p>

<p>As Prairie&ndash;bird briefly described the events above narrated,
Wingenund found some comfort in the reflection that War&ndash;Eagle,
Reginald, and their band had escaped the destruction
which had overwhelmed the Lenapé village: when she concluded,
he replied,</p>

<p>“It is enough; let my sister hope; let her speak fair words
to Mahéga: Wingenund will find his brothers, they will
follow the trail, my sister must not be afraid; many days and
nights may pass, but the Lenapé will be near her, and Netis
will be with them. Wingenund must go.”</p>

<p>How fain was Prairie&ndash;bird to ask him a thousand questions,
to give him a thousand cautions, and to send as many messages
by him to her lover! but, trained in the severe school of Indian
discipline, she knew that every word spoken or whispered increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the danger already incurred by Wingenund, and in
obedience to his hint she contented herself with silently invoking
the blessing of Heaven on the promised attempt to be
made by himself and his beloved coadjutors for her rescue.</p>

<p>“That pale&ndash;faced maiden speaks to herself all through the
night,” said one of the Osage warriors to his comrade stretched
beside him before the tent.</p>

<p>“I heard a sort of murmuring sound,” replied the other;
“but I shut my ears. Mahéga says that her words are like
the voices of spirits; it is not good to listen! Before this moon
is older I will ask her to curse Pâketshu, that Pawnee wolf
who killed my two brothers near the Nebraske.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Profiting by this brief dialogue, Wingenund crept from
under the buffalo&ndash;skin; and looking carefully around to see
whether any new change had taken place since his concealment,
he found that several of the Osage warriors, who had been
probably eating together, were now stretched around the tent,
and it was hopeless to attempt passing so many cunning and
vigilant foes undiscovered. While he was meditating on the
best course to be pursued, his attention was called to a noise
immediately in front of the tent, which was caused by the
horse ridden by Olitipa having broken from its tether and
entangled its legs in the halter. Springing on his feet,
Wingenund seized the leather&ndash;thong, using at the same time
the expressions common among the Osages for quieting a
fractious horse.</p>

<p>“What is it?” exclaimed at once several of the warriors,
half raising themselves from their recumbent posture.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Wingenund, in their own tongue;
“the pale&ndash;faced squaw’s horse has got loose.”</p>

<p>So saying, he stooped leisurely down, and fastened the
laryette again to the iron pin from which it had been detached.
Having secured the horse, he stood up again, and stepped
coolly over several of the Osages stretched around the tent;
and they, naturally mistaking him for one of their own party,
composed themselves again to sleep. Thus he passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the encampment, when he again threw himself upon the
ground, and again succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the
outposts, and in reaching safely the covert where he had left
his rifle and his accoutrements.</p>

<p>The active spirit of Wingenund was not yet wearied of
exertion. Seeing that the course taken by the Osages was
westerly, he went forward in that direction, and having
ascended an elevated height commanding a view of the adjoining
valleys, he concealed himself with the intention of
watching the enemy’s march.</p>

<p>On the following morning the Osages started at daybreak,
and marched until noon, when Mahéga halted them, and put
in execution the plan that he had formed for throwing off any
pursuit that might be attempted. He had brought four horses
from the Delaware encampment: of these he retained two for
the use of Prairie&ndash;bird and her attendant, and ordered their
hoofs to be covered with thick wrappers of bison&ndash;hide<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>; he
selected also ten of the warriors, on whose courage and fidelity
he could best depend; the remainder of the band he dismissed,
under the conduct of Flying&ndash;arrow, with the remaining two
horses laden with a portion of the Delaware spoils and trophies,
desiring them to strike off to the northward, and, making a trail
as distinct as possible, to return by a circuitous march to the
Osage village. These orders were punctually obeyed, and
Mahéga, having seen the larger moiety of his band start on
their appointed route, led off his own small party in a southwesterly
direction, through the hardest and roughest surface
that the prairie afforded, where he rightly judged that their
trail could with difficulty be followed, even by the lynx&ndash;eyed
chief of the Delawares.</p>

<p>From his concealment in the distance, Wingenund observed
the whole man&oelig;uvre: and having carefully noted the very
spot where the two trails separated, he ran back to the deserted
Lenapé village to carry out the plan that he had formed for
the pursuit. On his way he gathered a score of pliant willow
rods, and these lay at his feet when he stood in the attitude of
deep meditation, described at the commencement of this chapter.
He knew that if War&ndash;Eagle and his party returned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
safety from their expedition, their steps would be directed at
once to the spot on which he now stood, and his first care was
to convey to them all the information necessary for their guidance.
This he was enabled to do by marking with his knife
on slips of elm&ndash;bark various figures and designs, which War&ndash;Eagle
would easily understand. To describe these at length
would be tedious, in a narrative such as the present; all readers
who know anything of the history of the North American
Indians being aware of their sagacity in the use of these rude
hieroglyphics: it is sufficient here to state, that Wingenund
was able to express, in a manner intelligible to his kinsman,
that he himself marked the elm&ndash;bark, that Olitipa was prisoner
to Mahéga, that the Osage trail was to the west; that it
divided, the broad trail to the north being the wrong one; and
that he would hang on the right one, and make more marks for
War&ndash;Eagle to follow.</p>

<p>Having carefully noted these particulars, he stuck one of
his rods into the ground, and fastened to the top of it his roll
of elm&ndash;bark: then giving one more melancholy glance at the
desolate scene around him, he gathered up his willow&ndash;twigs,
and throwing himself again upon the Osage trail, never rested
his weary limbs until the burnt grass, upon a spot where the
party had cooked some bison&ndash;meat, assured him that he was
on their track; then he laid himself under a neighbouring
bush and slept soundly, trusting to his own sagacity for following
the trail over the boundless prairie before him.</p>

<p>While these events were passing on the Missouri prairie,
Paul Müller having been escorted to the settlements and set
free by the Osages, pursued his way towards St. Louis, then
the nucleus of Western trade, and the point whence all expeditions,
whether of a warlike or commercial nature, were
carried on in that region. He was walking slowly forward,
revolving in his mind the melancholy changes that had taken
place in the course of the last few weeks, the destruction of the
Lenapé band, and the captivity of his beloved pupil, when he
was overtaken by a sturdy and weather&ndash;beaten pedestrian, whose
person and attire seemed to have been roughly handled of late,
for his left arm was in a sling, various patches of plaster were
on his face and forehead, his leggins were torn to rags, and
the barrel of a rifle broken off from the stock was slung over
his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The missionary, turning round to greet his fellow&ndash;traveller
with his accustomed courtesy, encountered a countenance
which, notwithstanding its condition, he recognised as one
that he had seen in the Delaware village.</p>

<p>“Bearskin, my good friend,” said he, holding out his hand,
and grasping heartily the horny fist of the voyageur, “I am
right glad to see you, although it seems that you have received
some severe hurts; I feared you had fallen among the other
victims of that terrible day.”</p>

<p>“I can’t deny that the day was rough enough,” replied
Bearskin, looking down upon his wounded arm; “and the
red&ndash;skin devils left only one other of my party besides myself
alive: we contrived to beat off those who attacked our quarter,
but when we found that Mahéga had broken in upon the rear,
and had killed Mike Smith and his men, we made the best of
our way to the woods: several were shot and scalped, two of
us escaped: I received, as you see, a few ugly scratches, but
my old carcase is accustomed to being battered, and a week
will set it all to rights.”</p>

<p>“You know,” replied the missionary, “that I have some
skill in curing wounds. When we reach St. Louis we will
take up our lodging in the same house, and I will do what I
can to relieve your hurts. Moreover, there are many things
on which I wish to speak with you at leisure, and I have
friends there who will supply us with all that is needful for
our comfort.”</p>

<p>While they were thus conversing, the tall spires of the
cathedral became visible over the forest, which then grew dense
and unbroken to the very edge of the town, and in a few
minutes Bearskin, conducted by the missionary, was snugly
lodged in the dwelling of one of the wealthiest peltry&ndash;dealers
in the famous frontier city of St. Louis.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN AMBUSCADE.—REGINALD BRANDON FINDS HIS HORSE, AND M.
PERROT NEARLY LOSES HIS HEAD.—WHILE INDIAN PHILOSOPHY
IS DISPLAYED IN ONE QUARTER, INDIAN CREDULITY IS EXHIBITED
IN ANOTHER.</p>

<p class="pn">We left War&ndash;Eagle and his party posted in a thicket of considerable
extent, in the centre of a valley through which he
had calculated that the marauding band of Sioux would
return with the captured horses to their village; long and
anxiously did he wait in expectation of their appearance; and
both himself and Reginald began to fear that they must have
taken some other route, when they saw at a distance an Indian
galloping down the valley towards them; as he drew near, the
head&ndash;dress of eagle’s feathers, the scalp&ndash;locks on his leather
hunting&ndash;shirt, and the fringes by which his leggins were
adorned, announced him to the practised eye of the young
Delaware chief, as a Dahcotah brave of some distinction;
but what was the astonishment of Reginald, at recognising in
the fiery steed that bore him, his own lost Nekimi. By an
unconscious movement he threw forward his rifle over the log
which concealed him, and was preparing to secure a certain
aim, when War&ndash;Eagle, touching his arm, whispered, “Netis
not shoot, more Dahcotahs are coming,—noise of gun not
good here, Netis have enough fight soon,—leave this man to
War&ndash;Eagle, he give Netis back his horse.”</p>

<p>Reginald, although disappointed at not being allowed to
take vengeance on the approaching savage, saw the prudence
of his friend’s counsel, and suffering himself to be guided by
it, waited patiently to see how the Delaware proposed to act.
The latter, laying aside his rifle, and armed only with his
scalp&ndash;knife and tomahawk, crept to a thick bush on the edge of
the broad trail passing through the centre of the thicket; in his
hand he took a worn&ndash;out mocassin, which he threw carelessly
upon the track, and then ensconced himself in the hiding&ndash;place
which he had selected for his purpose. The Dahcotah
warrior, who had been sent forward by his chief to reconnoitre,
and to whom Nekimi had been lent on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the extraordinary speed which that animal had been found to
possess, slackened his speed as he entered the thicket, and
cast his wary eyes to the right and to the left, glancing
occasionally at the sides of the hills which overhung the
valley.</p>

<p>The Delawares were too well concealed to be seen from
the path, and he rode slowly forward until he came to the
spot where lay the mocassin thrown down by War&ndash;Eagle.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said the Sioux, uttering a hasty ejaculation, and
leaping from his horse to examine its fashion. As he stooped
to pick it up, War&ndash;Eagle sprung like a tiger upon him, and
with a single blow of his tomahawk laid the unfortunate
warrior dead at his feet. Throwing Nekimi’s bridle over his
arm, he drew the body into the adjacent thicket, and, having
found in the waistband the small leathern bag in which the
Indians of the Missouri usually carry the different coloured
clays wherewith they paint themselves, he proceeded to transform
himself into a Sioux. Putting on the Dahcotah head&ndash;dress
and other apparel, aided by one of the most experienced
of his band, he disguised himself in a few minutes so effectually
that, unless upon a very close inspection, he might well be
taken for the Indian whom he had just killed.</p>

<p>As soon as this operation was completed, he desired Reginald
and the rest of the party to remain concealed, and if he
succeeded in luring the enemy to the spot, on no account to
fire until their main body had reached the bush from which
he had sprung on the Sioux. Having given this instruction,
he vaulted on Nekimi’s back, and returned at speed to the
upper part of the valley, from which direction he knew that
the Dahcotahs must be approaching. He had not ridden
many miles ere he saw them advancing at a leisurely rate,
partly driving before them, and partly leading, the horses
stolen from the Delawares. This was an occasion on which
War&ndash;Eagle required all his sagacity and presence of mind, for
should he betray himself by a false movement or gesture, not
only would the enemy escape the snare laid for them, but his
life would pay the forfeit of his temerity. Wheeling his
horse about, he returned towards the thicket, and, after riding
to and fro, as if making a careful investigation of its paths and
foot&ndash;marks, he went back to the broad trail, and as soon as
the foremost of the Dahcotahs were within a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
hundred yards, he made the signal “All right<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>,” and rode
gently forward through the wood. So well did his party
observe the orders which he had given them, that, although
he knew the exact spot where they were posted, and scanned
it with the most searching glance of his keen eye, not a
vestige of a human figure, nor of a weapon could he detect,
and a smile of triumph curled his lip as he felt assured of the
success of his plan. No sooner had he passed the bush where
the Dahcotah had fallen, than he turned aside into the thicket,
and, having fastened Nekimi securely to a tree, tore off his
Sioux disguise, and resuming his own dress and rifle, concealed
himself on the flank of his party.</p>

<p>The Dahcotahs, who had, as they thought, seen their scout
make the sign of “All right,” after a careful examination of
the wood, entered it without either order or suspicion; neither
did they discover their mistake until the foremost reached the
fatal bush, when a volley from the ambuscade told among them
with terrible effect. Several of the Sioux fell at this first
discharge, and the confusion caused by this unexpected attack
was increased by the panic among the horses, some of which
being frightened, and others wounded, they reared and plunged
with ungovernable fury.</p>

<p>Although taken by surprise, the Dahcotah warriors behaved
with determined courage; throwing themselves from their
horses, they dashed into the thicket to dislodge their unseen
foes, and the fight became general, as well as desultory, each
man using a log or a tree for his own defence, and shooting,
either with rifle or bow, at any adversary whom he could see
for a moment exposed. The Sioux, though more numerous,
were unprovided with efficient fire&ndash;arms; and sensible of the
advantages thence arising to their opponents, they made desperate,
and not unsuccessful efforts to bring the fight to close
quarters. Reginald and War&ndash;Eagle were side by side, each
endeavouring to outdo the other in feats of gallantry, and at
the same time to watch over the safety of his friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsieur Perrot caught the general spirit of the affray, and,
as he afterwards said of himself, “fought like a famished
lion!” when, unluckily, his pistol snapped in the face of a
Sioux warrior, who struck him a blow that felled him to the
earth. Stepping lightly over the form of his prostrate foe, the
savage, grasping a knife in his right hand, and seizing the
luckless Frenchman’s hair with his left, was about to scalp
him, when the knife dropped from his hand, and he stood for
a moment petrified with astonishment and horror. The whole
head of hair was in his left hand, and the white man sat grinning
before him with a smooth and shaven crown.</p>

<p>Letting fall what he believed to be the scalp of some devil
in human shape, the affrighted Sioux fled from the spot, while
Perrot, replacing his wig, muttered half aloud, “<i>Bravo! ma
bonne perruque! je te dois mille remerçimens!</i>”</p>

<p>At this crisis, while the issue of the general combat was still
doubtful, the sound of a bugle was heard in the distance, and
the signal immediately answered by Reginald, who shouted
aloud to War&ndash;Eagle, that Grande&ndash;Hâche was at hand. Inspired
by the knowledge of approaching reinforcement, the
Delawares fought with renewed confidence, while the Dahcotahs,
startled by the strange and unknown bugle calls, were
proportionately confused and thrown into disorder. The panic
among them was complete when the sharp crack of Baptiste’s
rifle was heard in the rear, and one of their principal braves fell
dead at the root of the tree which sheltered him from the fire of
War&ndash;Eagle’s party. Hemmed in between the two hostile bands,
the Sioux now gave up all hope of concealment, and fought
with the courage of despair; but the resistance which they
offered was neither effective nor of long duration. Baptiste,
wielding his terrible axe, seemed resolved this day to wreak
his fierce and long&ndash;delayed vengeance on the tribe at whose
hands he had sustained such deadly injury; and regardless of
several slight wounds which he received in the fray, continued
to deal destruction among all who came within reach. Nor
were Reginald and War&ndash;Eagle less active in the fight; the
struggle was hand to hand; the Sioux seeming to expect no
quarter, and being determined to fight while they could wield
a knife or tomahawk.</p>

<p>Their chief, a man of stature almost as powerful as that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Mahéga, seemed gifted with a charmed life, for although he
exposed himself freely to the boldest of his opponents, animating
his men by shouting aloud the terrible war&ndash;cry of the
Dahcotahs<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, and rushing to their aid wherever he found them
giving way, he was hitherto unhurt, and bent every effort to
destroy War&ndash;Eagle, whom he easily recognised as the leader,
and most formidable of the Delawares. An opportunity soon
offered itself, as War&ndash;Eagle was engaged with another of the
Dahcotahs. The chief aimed at his unguarded head a blow
that must have proved fatal, had not Reginald warded it off
with his cutlass; the Indian turned furiously upon him, and a
fierce combat ensued, but it was not of long duration, for after
they had exchanged a few strokes, a successful thrust stretched
the Dahcotah chief upon the ground. An exulting cry burst
from the Delawares, and the panic&ndash;struck Sioux fled in every
direction. The pursuit was conducted with the merciless
eagerness common to Indian warfare, and as Reginald felt no
inclination to join in it, he returned his cutlass to its sheath,
and busied himself in securing all the horses that came within
his reach.</p>

<p>One by one the Delawares came back to the place of rendezvous,
some bearing with them the scalps which they had
taken, others leading recaptured horses, and all in the highest
excitement of triumph.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle set free Nekimi, and led it towards its master.
As soon as it was near enough to hear his voice, Reginald
called to the noble animal, which, shaking its flowing mane,
came bounding and snorting towards him. He caressed it for
a short time, then vaulted upon its back, and was delighted to
find that its spirit and strength had suffered no diminution
since its capture. Again he dismounted, and Nekimi followed
him unled, playing round him like a favourite dog. While he
thus amused himself with his recovered steed, Baptiste sat by
the side of a small streamlet, cleaning his axe and his rifle, and
listening with a grim smile to Monsieur Perrot’s account of the
danger from which he had been saved by his peruke. In the
midst of his narrative, seeing some blood on the sleeve of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
companion’s shirt, he said, “Baptiste, you are surely
wounded?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the other; “one of the red&ndash;skins gave me a
smartish stroke with a knife in that skrimmage—however, I
forgive him, as I paid him for it.”</p>

<p>“But would it not be better to attend to your wound first,
and to your weapons afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, Monsieur Perrot, that isn’t our fashion in the
woods; I like first to make the doctor ready for service, and
then it will be time enough to put a little cold water and a
bandage to the cut.”</p>

<p>The good&ndash;humoured Frenchman insisted upon his proposal,
but had some difficulty in persuading the rough guide to let
him dress the wound, which, though deep and painful, was
not dangerous.</p>

<p>On the following day, War&ndash;Eagle returned with his triumphant
party and with the rescued horses towards the
Delaware village, every bosom, save one, beating high with
exultation. Reginald could scarcely control his impatience to
relate to Prairie&ndash;bird the events of the successful expedition.
The young warriors anticipated with joy the beaming smiles
with which they would be welcomed by the Lenapé maidens;
while those of maturer age looked forward to the well&ndash;merited
applause of their chiefs, and the fierce excitement of the war&ndash;dance
with which their victory would be celebrated. Baptiste
had satiated his long&ndash;cherished vengeance on the tribe which
had destroyed his parents, and Monsieur Perrot prepared many
jokes and gibes, which he proposed to inflict upon Mike Smith,
and those who had not partaken in the glory which he and his
party had gained.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle alone shared not in the general joy! Whether
it was that he could not prevent his thoughts from reverting
to Prairie&ndash;bird, or that he was oppressed by a vague and mysterious
presentiment of calamity, his demeanour was grave,
even to sadness, and the trophies of victory hung neglected
from the fringes of his dress.</p>

<p>Having taken the shortest route, they arrived, a few hours
before nightfall, at a point where a broad trail led direct to
the encampment; and War&ndash;Eagle, whose penetrating eye had
marked his friend’s impatience, and who never lost an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of proving to him the warmth of his attachment, said to
him,</p>

<p>“Netis should go forward and tell Tamenund and the
chiefs, that the Lenapé war&ndash;party are coming, and that the
Dahcotah scalps are many. It will be a pleasant tale for
the ancient chiefs, and it is good that they hear it from the
mouth of the bravest warrior.”</p>

<p>This compliment was paid to him aloud, and in the hearing
of the whole band, who signified their approbation by the usual
quick and repeated exclamation.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Reginald replied, “No one is bravest here; where War&ndash;Eagle
leads, none but brave men are worthy to follow.”</p>

<p>The next minute Nekimi was in full speed towards the
village; and the Delaware band, with Baptiste and Perrot,
moved leisurely forward after him.</p>

<p>Scarcely two hours had elapsed when a single horseman was
seen riding towards them, in whom, as he drew near, they
had some difficulty in recognising Reginald, for his dress
was soiled, his countenance haggard and horror&ndash;stricken,
while the foaming sides and wide&ndash;dilated nostril of Nekimi
showed that he had been riding with frantic and furious
speed. All made way for him, and he spoke to none until
he drew his bridle by the side of War&ndash;Eagle, and beckoned
to him and to Baptiste to come aside. For a moment he
looked at the former in silence with an eye so troubled,
that the guide feared that some dreadful accident had unsettled
his young master’s mind, but that fear was almost
immediately relieved by Reginald, who, taking his friend’s
hand, said to him, in a voice almost inarticulate from suppressed
emotion,</p>

<p>“I bring you, War&ndash;Eagle, dreadful—dreadful news.”</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle knows that the sun does not always shine,”
was the calm reply.</p>

<p>“But this is darkness,” said Reginald, shuddering; “black
darkness, where there is neither sun nor moon, not even a
star!”</p>

<p>“My brother,” said the Indian, drawing himself proudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to his full height; “my brother speaks without thinking.
The sun shines still, and the stars are bright in their place.
The Great Spirit dwells always among them; a thick cloud
may hide them from our eyes, but my brother knows they are
shining as brightly as ever.”</p>

<p>The young man looked with wonder and awe upon the lofty
countenance of this untaught philosopher of the wilderness;
and he replied, “War&ndash;Eagle is right. The Great Spirit
sees all, and whatever he does is good! But sometimes
the cup of misfortune is so full and so bitter, that man can
hardly drink it and live.”</p>

<p>“Let Netis speak all and conceal nothing,” said the chief:
“what has he seen at the village?”</p>

<p>“<i>There is no village!</i>” said the young man in an agony of
grief. “The lodges are overthrown; Tamenund, the Black
Father, Olitipa, all are gone; wolves and vultures are quarrelling
over the bones of unburied Lenapé!”</p>

<p>As Reginald concluded his tragic narrative, an attentive observer
might have seen that the muscles and nerves in the
powerful frame of the Indian contracted for an instant, but no
change was visible on his haughty and commanding brow, as
he stood before the bearer of this dreadful news a living impersonation
of the stern and stoic philosophy of his race.</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle,” said Reginald, “can you explain this calamity—do
you see through it—how has it happened?”</p>

<p>“<i>Mahéga</i>,” was the brief and emphatic reply.</p>

<p>“Do you believe that the monster has murdered all, men,
women, and children?” said Reginald, whose thoughts were fixed
on Prairie&ndash;bird, but whose lips refused to pronounce her name.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the chief; “not all, the life of Olitipa is
safe, if she becomes the wife of that wolf; for the others,
War&ndash;Eagle cannot tell. The Washashe love to take scalps,
woman, child, or warrior, it is all one to them; it is enough.
War&ndash;Eagle must speak to his people.”</p>

<p>After a minute’s interval, the chief accordingly summoned
his faithful band around him, and in brief but pathetic language
informed them of the disaster that had befallen their
tribe. Reginald could not listen unmoved to the piercing cries
and groans with which the Delawares rent the air on receiving
this intelligence, although his own heart was racked with anxiety
concerning the fate of his beloved Prairie&ndash;bird. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the surrounding warriors thus gave unrestrained vent to their
lamentations, War&ndash;Eagle stood like some antique statue of
bronze, in an attitude of haughty repose, his broad chest thrown
forward, and his erect front, bearing the impress of an unconquerable
will, bidding defiance alike to the human weakness
that might assail from within, and the storms of fate that
might threaten from without. The stern and impressive
silence of his grief produced, ere long, its effect upon his followers;
by degrees the sounds of wailing died away, and as
the short twilight of that climate was rapidly merging into
darkness, the chief, taking Reginald’s arm, moved forward,
whispering to him in a tone, the deep and gloomy meaning of
which haunted his memory long afterwards,</p>

<p>“The spirit of Tamenund calls to War&ndash;Eagle and asks,
‘Where is Mahéga?’”</p>

<p>On the following morning War&ndash;Eagle rose an hour before
daybreak, and led his party to the spot where the lodges of
their kindred had so lately stood, and where they had anticipated
a reception of honour and triumph. The chief strode
forward across the desolate scene, seemingly insensible to its
horrors; faithful to his determination, all the energies of his
nature were concentrated in the burning thirst for revenge,
which expelled, for the time, every other feeling from his
breast. The Delaware warriors, observant of the stern demeanour
of their leader, followed him in gloomy silence;
and although each shuddered as he passed the well&ndash;known
spot where, only a few days before, an anxious wife had
prepared his food, and merry children had prattled round his
knee, not a groan nor a complaint was uttered; but every
bosom throbbed under the expectation of a vengeance so
terrible, that it should be remembered by the Osages to the
latest hour of their existence as a tribe.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle moved directly forward to the place where the
lodge of Tamenund and the tent of the Prairie&ndash;bird had been
pitched. As they approached it Reginald felt his heart faint
within him, and the colour fled from his cheek and lip.</p>

<p>Baptiste, taking his master’s hand, said to him, in a tone of
voice the habitual roughness of which was softened by genuine
sympathy, “Master Reginald, remember where you are; the
eyes of the Lenapé are upon the adopted brother of their
chief; they have lost fathers, brothers, wives, and children;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
see how they bear their loss; let them not think Netis less
brave than themselves.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you, honest Baptiste,” said the unhappy
young man, wringing the woodman’s horny hand; “I
will neither disgrace my own, nor my adopted name; but who
among them can compare his loss with mine! so young, so
fair, so gentle, my own affianced bride; pledged to me under
the eye of Heaven, and now in the hands of that fierce and merciless
villain.”</p>

<p>At this moment a cry of exultation burst from the lips of
War&ndash;Eagle, as his eye fell upon the wand and slips of bark
left by Wingenund. One by one the chief examined them,
and deciphering their meaning with rapid and unerring sagacity,
communicated to his friend that the youth was still alive
and free; that Olitipa, though a prisoner, was well, and that
a fine trail was open for them to follow.</p>

<p>“Let us start upon it this instant,” cried Reginald, with the
re&ndash;awakened impetuosity of his nature.</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle must take much counsel with himself,” replied
the chief, gravely. “The ancient men of the Lenapé are
asleep, their bones are uncovered; War&ndash;Eagle must not forget
them; but,” he added, while a terrible fire shot from his dark
eye, “if the Great Spirit grants him life, he will bring Netis
within reach of Mahéga before this young moon’s horn becomes
a circle.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, he resumed his scrutiny of the ciphers
and figures drawn upon the bark; nor did he cease it until he
fully understood their purport; he then called together his
band, and explained to them his further plans, which were
briefly these:—</p>

<p>He selected ten of the youngest and most active, who were
to accompany him, with Reginald, Baptiste, and Perrot, on
the trail of Mahéga; the remainder of the party, under the
guidance of an experienced brave, were to follow the more
numerous body of the Osages, to hang on their trail, and never
to leave it while there remained a chance or a hope of an enemy’s
scalp. Two of the Delawares were at the same time
despatched, one to seek the aid and sympathy of the Konsas
and other friendly, or neutral tribes, the other to prowl about
the woods in the neighbourhood, to collect any fugitives who
might have escaped, and guide any party that might be formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to aid in the meditated pursuit. He also ordered the larger
party to gather the bones and relics of their kindred, and to
perform the rites of sepulture, according to the custom of the
tribe.</p>

<p>While the chief was giving these instructions to the several
parties above designated, Reginald sat musing on the very
grass over which the tent of his beloved had been spread; no
blood had there been spilt; it had been spared the desecration
of the vulture and the wolf; her spirit seemed to hover unseen
over the spot; and shutting his eyes, the lover fancied he could
still hear her sweet voice, attuned to the simple accompaniment
of her Mexican guitar.</p>

<p>How long this waking dream possessed his senses he knew
not, but he was awakened from it by War&ndash;Eagle, who whispered
in his ear, “The trail of Mahéga waits for my brother.”
Ashamed of his temporary weakness, Reginald sprung to his
feet, and thence upon the back of Nekimi. The chief having
chosen four of the strongest and best from the recaptured
horses, one for the use of Perrot, the others for such emergencies
as might occur, left the remainder with the main body
of the Delawares, and, accompanied by his small party
thoroughly well armed and equipped, started on the trail in
pursuit of the Osages.</p>

<p>While these events were passing near the site of the Lenapé
village, Mahéga pursued his westward course with unremitting
activity, for although he felt little apprehension from the broken
and dispirited band of Delawares, he knew that he was entering
a region which was the hunting&ndash;ground of the Pawnees,
Otoes, Ioways, and other tribes, all of whom would consider
him a trespasser, and would be disposed to view his present
expedition in the light of a hostile incursion; for this reason,
although he was amply provided with presents for such Indians
as he might fall in with, from the plunder of the Delaware
lodges, he marched with the greatest rapidity and caution, and
never relaxed his speed until he had passed that dangerous
region, and had entered upon the higher, and, comparatively,
less frequented plain, lying between the waters of the Nebraska,
or Platte River, and the lower ridges, known by the name of
the Spurs of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>During the whole of this tedious march the attention paid
to the comfort of Olitipa by her wild and wayward captor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
constant and respectful; secure, as he thought, from pursuit,
he had determined to gain her confidence and affection, and
thus to share in that mysterious knowledge and power which
he believed her to possess, and which he well knew that force
or harshness would never induce her to impart. Thus she
remained continually attended by her favourite Lita; when
the band halted for refreshment, the choicest morsels were set
apart for her use, and the young branches of the willow or
poplar were gathered to shelter her from the sun. Mahéga
rarely addressed her, but when he did so it was in language
calculated to dispel all apprehension of present injury or insult;
and Prairie&ndash;bird, remembering the parting counsel of the missionary,
replied to the haughty chief’s inquiries with courtesy
and gentleness; although she could not help shuddering when
she remembered his former violence, and the dreadful massacre
at the Delaware village, she felt deeply grateful to Heaven for
having softened the tiger’s heart towards her, and for having
led him, by means and motives unknown to herself, to consult
her safety and her comfort.</p>

<p>On one occasion during the march, Mahéga availed himself
of her mysterious acquirements, in a manner that reflected
great credit upon his sagacity, at the same time that it increased,
in a tenfold degree, the awe with which she had inspired him
and his adherents. They had made their usual halt at noon,
by the side of a small stream; Prairie&ndash;bird and her faithful
Lita were sheltered from the burning rays of the sun by an
arbour of alder&ndash;branches, which the Osages had hastily, but
not inconveniently, constructed; Mahéga and his warriors
being occupied in eating the dainty morsels of meat afforded
by a young buffalo cow killed on the preceding day, when a
large band of Indians appeared on the brow of a neighbouring
hill, and came down at full speed towards the Osage encampment
Mahéga, without manifesting any uneasiness, desired
his men to pile a few of their most valuable packages within
the arbour of Olitipa, and to form themselves in a semicircle
around, for its protection, their bows and rifles being ready for
immediate use. Having made these dispositions, he waited
the approach of the strangers, quietly cutting his buffalo beef,
and eating it, as if secure of their friendly intentions. Having
come within a hundred yards, they drew in their bridles on a
signal from their leader, who seemed disposed to take a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
deliberate survey of the party. From their appearance Mahéga
knew that they must belong to one of the wild roving
tribes who hunt between the sources of the Platte and Arkansas
rivers, but the name or designation of their tribe he was at first
unable to make out. Their weapons were bows and arrows,
short clubs, and knives; their dress, a hunting&ndash;shirt of half&ndash;dressed
skin, a centre&ndash;cloth of the same material, and mocassins
on their feet, leaving the legs entirely bare; the leader
had long hair, clubbed at the back of his head, and fastened
with sinew&ndash;strings round a wooden pin, to which were attached
several stained feathers, which danced in the wind, and
heightened the picturesque effect of his costume.</p>

<p>A rapid glance sufficed to show him that the new comers,
although apparently busied about their meal without distrust,
were not only well armed but ready for immediate service;
nor did his eye fail to note the martial bearing and gigantic
proportions of Mahéga, who sat like a chief expecting the
approach of an inferior.</p>

<p>Influenced by these observations, the leader of the roving
band resolved that the first intercourse at least should be of a
peaceful nature, prudently reflecting, that as his own numbers
were far superior, the nearer the quarters the greater would be
their advantage. Having uttered a few brief words to his followers,
he advanced with a friendly gesture towards Mahéga,
and the following dialogue took place, in the ingenious language
of signs before referred to:—</p>

<p><i>Mahéga.</i>—“What tribe are you?”</p>

<p><i>Leader.</i>—“Ari&ndash;ca&ndash;rá.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> What are you, and whither going?”</p>

<p><i>M.</i>—“Washashee, going to the mountains.”</p>

<p><i>L.</i>—“What seek you there?”</p>

<p><i>M.</i>—“Beaver, otter, and grisly bear&ndash;skins.”</p>

<p><i>L.</i>—“Good. What is in the green&ndash;branch wigwam?”</p>

<p><i>M.</i>—“Great Medicine—let the Aricará beware.” To
this the chief added the sign usually employed for their most
solemn mysteries.</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on, the rovers of the
wilderness had gradually drawn nearer, not, however, unperceived
by Mahéga, who, throwing down a strip of blanket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
at a distance of twenty yards from the arbour of Prairie&ndash;bird,
explained by a sign sufficiently intelligible, that if the main
body of them crossed that line, his party would shoot.</p>

<p>At a signal from their leader they again halted; and
Mahéga observed that from time to time they threw hasty
glances over the hill whence they had come, from which he
inferred that more of their tribe were in the immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile their leader, whose curiosity urged him to
discover what Great Medicine was contained in the arbour,
advanced fearlessly alone within the forbidden precincts, thus
placing his own life at the mercy of the Osages.</p>

<p>Ordering his men to keep a strict watch on the movements
of the Aricarás, and to shoot the first whom they might detect
in fitting an arrow to his bow&ndash;string, Mahéga now lighted a
pipe, and courteously invited their leader to smoke; between
every successive whiff exhaled by the latter, he cast an
inquisitive glance towards the arbour, but the packages and
the leafy branches baffled his curiosity; meanwhile the preliminaries
of peace having been thus amicably interchanged,
the other Aricarás cast themselves from their horses, and
having given them in charge to a few of the youngest of the
party, the remainder sat in a semicircle, and gravely accepted
the pipes handed to them by order of Mahéga.</p>

<p>That chief, aware of the mischievous propensities of his
new friends, and equally averse to intimacy or hostility with
such dangerous neighbours, had bethought himself of a
scheme by which he might at once get rid of them by inspiring
them with superstitious awe, and gratify himself with
a sight of one of those wonders which the missionary had
referred to in his last warning respecting the Prairie&ndash;bird.
It was not long before the curious Aricará again expressed his
desire to know the Great Medicine contents of the arbour.
To this Mahéga replied,</p>

<p>“A woman,” adding again the sign of solemn mystery.</p>

<p>“A woman!” replied the leader, in his own tongue,
expressing in his countenance the scorn and disappointment
that he felt.</p>

<p>“A woman,” repeated Mahéga, gravely; “but a Medicine
Spirit. We travel to the mountains; she will then go to the
land of spirits.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>The Aricará made here a gesture of impatient incredulity,
with a sign that, if he could not see some medicine&ndash;feat, he
would believe that the Osage spoke lies.</p>

<p>Mahéga, desiring him to sit still, and his own party to be
watchful, now approached the arbour, and, addressing Prairie&ndash;bird
in the Delaware tongue, explained to her their present
situation, and the dangerous vicinity of a mischievous, if not
a hostile tribe, adding, at the same time,</p>

<p>“Olitipa must show some wonder to frighten these bad
men.”</p>

<p>“What is it to Olitipa,” replied the maiden, coldly, “whether
she is a prisoner to the Osage, or to the Western Tribe?
perhaps they would let her go.”</p>

<p>“Whither?” answered the chief. “Does Olitipa think
that these prairie wolves would shelter her fair skin from the
sun, or serve and protect her as Mahéga does? If she were
their prisoner they would take from her every thing she has,
even her medicine book, and make her bring water, and carry
burdens, and bear children to the man who should take
Mahéga’s scalp.”</p>

<p>Bad as was her present plight and her future prospect, the
poor girl could not help shuddering at the picture of hopeless
drudgery here presented to her eyes, and she replied,</p>

<p>“What does the Osage chief wish? How should his
prisoner frighten these wild men?”</p>

<p>“The Black Father said that Olitipa could gather the
beams of the sun, as our daughters collect the waters of the
stream in a vessel,” said the chief in a low tone.</p>

<p>Instantly catching the hint here given by her beloved instructor,
and believing that nothing done in obedience to his
wishes could be in itself wrong, she resolved to avail herself
of this opportunity of exciting the superstitious awe of the
savages, and she replied,</p>

<p>“It is good. Let Mahéga sit by the strange men; Olitipa
will come.”</p>

<p>Hastily winding a party&ndash;coloured kerchief in the form of a
turban, around the rich tresses of her dark hair, and throwing
a scarf over her shoulder, she took her small bag, or reticule,
in her hand, and stepped forth from the arbour. Such an
apparition of youthful bloom, grace, and beauty, extracted,
even from the wild leader of the Aricarás, an exclamation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
astonished admiration. Having seated herself upon a finely
painted bison robe, placed for her by Lita, she waited gravely
until Mahéga should have prepared the stranger chief for
what was to follow.</p>

<p>It was now scarcely an hour after noon, and the sun shone
full upon them, with bright and excessive heat; Mahéga,
pointing upward, explained to the Aricará that the Woman&ndash;Spirit
would bring some fire down from that distant orb.
He could not give any further information, being totally
ignorant of the nature of the wonder to be wrought, and as
anxious to witness it as the wild chief himself.</p>

<p>“Where will she place it?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“In the chief’s hand,” replied the maiden, whose intelligent
mind had long since, during her residence with the
Delawares, become familiar with the language of signs.</p>

<p>The two leaders now explained to their followers, in their
respective tongues, the great medicine which they were about to
see; and the latter, forgetful alike of distrust and precaution,
crowded with irresistible curiosity about the spot, Mahéga
alone preserving his habitual self&ndash;command, and warning those
nearest to him to be prepared against treachery or surprise.
The only ornament worn by the Aricará leader was a collar,
made of dark blue cloth, adorned with porcupine quills, and
girt with the formidable claws of the grisly bear. This collar,
being at once a trophy of his prowess, and a proof of its
having been gained among the Rocky Mountain traders (from
whom alone the cloth could have been procured in that remote
region), was highly prized both by the owner and his followers,
and was, therefore, as well as from its colour, selected by
Prairie&ndash;bird as a fitting object on which to work her “medicine
wonder.” She desired him to take it from his neck, and
to place it on the grass, with his hands below it, that no fire
might come near it. When he had complied with her request,
she drew from her bag a burning&ndash;glass, and, carefully adjusting
the focus, held it over the dark blue cloth, in which
ere long a hole was burnt, and the astonished leader’s hand
below was scorched.</p>

<p>It is impossible to depict the wonder and awe of the
attentive savages; they looked first at her, then at her glass,
then at the sun; then they re&ndash;examined the cloth, and
ascertained that it was indeed burnt through, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
smell of fire still rested on the edge of the aperture. After
this they withdrew several paces from the spot, the leader
inquiring with submissive signs whether he might replace the
collar? To which inquiry the maiden gravely bowing assent,
retired again into the arbour. For some time a profound
silence ensued, the Osages being as much awe&ndash;struck as the
Aricarás; even Mahéga himself was not proof against the
prevalent feeling of superstitious terror; and thus, while
desiring Prairie&ndash;bird to terrify others, he had unconsciously
furnished her with a mysterious and powerful check upon
himself.</p>

<p>It was not long before the Aricarás rose to take leave,—their
chief presenting Mahéga with a fine horse; and receiving
in return sundry ornaments and trinkets, of no real value,
but highly prized from their rarity in that wild and desolate
region. As they withdrew, they cast many a furtive glance
at the arbour and its mysterious tenant, seemingly glad when
they found themselves at such a distance as rendered them
safe from her supernatural influence. On their return to their
own people, they related, with considerable exaggeration, the
wonders which they had witnessed; and Prairie&ndash;bird was
long afterwards spoken of in the tribe by a name equally impossible
to print, or to pronounce, but which, if translated into
English, would be, “The Great&ndash;Medicine&ndash;Daughter&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;burning&ndash;sun!”</p>


<p>After this adventure, Mahéga pursued his uninterrupted
way towards the spurs of the Rocky Mountains; his manner
and bearing towards Prairie&ndash;bird being more deferential than
ever, and the passion that he entertained for her being checked
and awed by the miraculous power that she had displayed; he
still nourished strong hopes of being able ultimately to gain her
affection, but in the meantime resolved to turn her supernatural
skill to good account, by frightening such wild roving bands
as they might fall in with, and extorting from their superstitious
fears valuable presents in horses and peltry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the maiden’s observant eye had marked the effect
upon Mahéga produced by the burning&ndash;glass, in spite of his
well&ndash;dissembled indifference, and she secretly determined that
the chief use that she could make of such exhibitions as were
calculated to excite superstitious awe among Indians, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
be to maintain the command over Mahéga which she was
conscious she now possessed.</p>

<p>During the whole of this long and toilsome march, the
faithful and indefatigable Wingenund hovered over the trail
at such a distance as never to be perceived by any of the
party, and left at occasional intervals a willow&ndash;rod, or a slip
of bark, so marked as to be a sure guide to an eye less keen
and sagacious than that of War&ndash;Eagle. His only food was
dried undressed buffalo meat; his drink, the stream where the
Osages had slacked their thirst; his bed, the barren prairie;
he made no fire to scare away the prowling wolves, that yelped
and howled at night round his solitary couch, his only protection
from their ravenous hunger being a tuft of damp grass,
over which he rubbed some powder from his flask. Twice was
he descried and pursued by roving bands of Indians, but on
both occasions saved himself by his extraordinary fleetness of
foot; and the moment that the immediate danger was over,
renewed his weary and difficult task.</p>

<p>Cheered by his deep affection for his sister, encouraged by
the approval which he knew that his exertions would meet
from War&ndash;Eagle and Reginald, and, more than all, stimulated
by the eager desire to distinguish himself as a Delaware chief
on this his first war&ndash;path, the faithful youth hung over the
long and circuitous trail of his enemies with the patience and
unerring sagacity of a bloodhound; and though she saw him
not, Prairie&ndash;bird felt a confident assurance that her beloved
young brother would be true to his promise, and would never
leave nor desert her while the pulses of life continued to beat
in his affectionate heart.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">ETHELSTON VISITS ST. LOUIS, WHERE HE UNEXPECTEDLY MEETS AN
OLD ACQUAINTANCE, AND UNDERTAKES A LONGER JOURNEY THAN
HE HAD CONTEMPLATED.</p>

<p class="pn">During the occurrence of the events related in the preceding
chapters, the disputes and difficulties attending the distribution
of peltries among the different fur companies at St. Louis had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
rather increased than diminished, and Ethelston had found
himself compelled, however unwillingly, again to bid adieu to
Lucy, and take a trip to the Mississippi for the arrangement
of his guardian’s affairs in that quarter; a considerable portion
of the fortune that he inherited from his father was invested in
the same speculation, and he could not, without incurring the
charge of culpable negligence, leave it in the hands of others at
a great distance, many of whose interests might perhaps be at
variance with those of Colonel Brandon and himself.</p>

<p>He had been only a short time in St. Louis when, one day,
on passing the cathedral, he met two men, whose appearance
attracted his attention. The one was past the meridian of life,
and the benevolent thoughtfulness of his countenance accorded
well with the sober suit of black that indicated the profession
to which he belonged; the other was a stout, square&ndash;built
man, evidently cast in a coarser mould than his companion,
but apparently conversing with him on terms of friendly
familiarity. After looking stedfastly at this second, Ethelston
felt convinced that he was not mistaken in addressing him:
“Bearskin, my good friend, how come you to be in St. Louis?
I thought you were busy, bear and buffalo hunting with my
friend Reginald, among the Delawares of the Missouri?”</p>

<p>“Ha! Master Ethelston,” replied the sturdy voyageur, “I
am right glad to see your face here. We have been in some
trouble of late, and instead of our hunting the bears, the bears
has hunted us.”</p>

<p>“I see you have been in some trouble,” said Ethelston,
noticing for the first time the boatman’s scars and bruises;
“but tell me,” he added, hastily catching him by the arm,
“has any evil befallen my friend, my brother Reginald?”</p>

<p>“No harm that I knows of,” replied the other; “but I
must say that things wern’t what a man might call altogether
pleasant, where I left him.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Ethelston, with an indignation that
he made no attempt to conceal, “you left him in danger or in
difficulties, and can give no account of him? Bearskin, I
would not have believed this of you, unless I had it from your
own lips!”</p>

<p>“Master Ethelston,” answered the justly offended voyageur,
“a man that goes full swing down the stream of his own
notions, without heeding oar or helm, is sure to run athwart a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
snag; here’s my worthy friend here, Paul Müller, and though
he is a preacher, I’ll hold him as honest a man as any in the
territory; he can tell you the whole story from one end to
t’other; and when he’s done so, perhaps you’ll be sorry for
what you’ve said to old Bearskin.”</p>

<p>“I am already sorry,” replied Ethelston, moved by the
earnest simplicity of the scarred and weather&ndash;beaten boatman.
“I am already sorry that I have done you wrong, but you
will make allowance for my impatience and anxiety concerning
my brother’s fate!” (Ethelston always spoke of Reginald as
his brother, for he had a secret and undefined pleasure in so
doing, as it implied his union with the sister of his friend.)
Paul Müller, easily guessing from the few words that had
passed that the person now addressing Bearskin was the Edward
Ethelston of whom Reginald had so often spoken to him,
said,</p>

<p>“Sir, you certainly did an injustice to Bearskin, in thinking
him capable of deserting a friend in need; but the apology
you have offered is, I am sure, sufficient to satisfy him. The
intelligence which I have to communicate respecting Reginald
Brandon and his party is in some respects exceedingly melancholy;
if you will accompany me to our lodging, which is just
at hand, I will explain it to you in full; meanwhile, rest satisfied
with the assurance that, to the best of our belief, your
friend is safe and well in health.”</p>

<p>As soon as they had entered the house, Bearskin, forgetting
the hasty words which had so much hurt his feelings, busied
himself in preparing some refreshment for Ethelston, while the
missionary related to him all that had occurred since his friend
joined the Delaware encampment. He did not even conceal
from him the violent passion that the latter had conceived for
Prairie&ndash;bird, and the despair with which, on his return to the
village from the Sioux expedition, he would learn the destruction
of her kindred, and her own captivity among the
Osages.</p>

<p>“Indeed, my good sir,” said Ethelston, “I must freely
confess that this portion of your intelligence is the only one
that brings with it any comfort: the fate of Mike Smith and
his companions, and the destruction of the unoffending Delawares,
are disasters deeply to be lamented; but, surely, the fact
of the Osage chief having carried off the Indian maiden whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
you call Prairie&ndash;bird, and who seems to have exercised such a
strange fascination over Reginald Brandon, can scarcely be regretted:
for she will be more likely to find a congenial mate
among the red&ndash;skins, and a bitter disappointment will be spared
to my excellent guardian Colonel Brandon.”</p>

<p>“I know not, my son,” answered the missionary mildly;
“the ways of Providence are inscrutable, and it does frequently
happen, as you say, that events which we lament at the moment,
afford afterwards just grounds for rejoicing. Nevertheless,
I cannot view this matter exactly as you do, for I have
known the maiden from her childhood, and she is a more
fitting bride for a Christian gentleman, than for a heathen
warrior.”</p>

<p>“I did, indeed, hear the Colonel, and the other members of
the family at Mooshanne, say that the Delaware youth who so
bravely defended the life of Reginald at the risk of his own
had spoken in the highest terms of praise respecting his sister
the Prairie&ndash;bird, as if she were a being of a superior race; but
you, my good father, are above the prejudices which darken
the minds of these Indians; and you must therefore know, that
whatever may be her beauty and amiable qualities, she is, after
all, the daughter of a Delaware chief, and, as such, could not
be a welcome inmate of my guardian’s house.”</p>

<p>“Nay, my son,” replied the missionary, “she is but the
adopted child of the venerable Delaware who lately fell in the
massacre which I have related to you; she was not of his
blood nor of his race; such qualities and nature as she possesses
have been in some measure the fruit of my own care and
toil. Were it not that you might mistake my language for
that of boasting, I would say, that although the prairie has
been her dwelling, and a Lenapé tent her home, she does not
in her education fall far short of your maidens in the settlements,
who have had greater advantages of instruction.”</p>

<p>The conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of a
negro with refreshment, preceded by Bearskin, bearing in his
hand a bottle of French brandy, of which he vaunted, not
without reason, the excellent quality and flavour; but Ethelston
continued to converse in an under tone with the missionary,
his countenance evincing every moment increased eagerness and
interest in the subject of their discourse, which so absorbed his
attention, that he never noticed the honest boatman’s repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
attempts to call his attention to the refreshment which he had
prepared. Even Paul Müller was unable to comprehend this
sudden change in his manner, and his vehement desire to know
all the most minute particulars respecting a person of whom he
had spoken a few minutes before in terms of disparagement; but
he attributed it to the interest which he took in his friend’s selected
bride, and satisfied his curiosity to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>When all his many and rapidly uttered questions were answered,
Ethelston rose from his seat, and abruptly took his
departure, saying, as he left the room, “Thanks, thanks, my
good friends, you shall see me again ere long.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I care not much how long it may be before I see
his face again,” said Bearskin sulkily. “Here have I been
bothering myself to make Pompey bring up these cakes and,
fruits, and I have opened a bottle of Father Antin’s best
brandy, and he goes off without tasting with us, or so much
as taking a drop to wash down the ill words which were in his
mouth a while since.”</p>

<p>“Nay, my good friend,” replied the missionary, “be not
hasty to censure Master Ethelston, for he is a true and zealous
friend to Reginald Brandon, and the news from the west seems
to have affected him with much anxiety and alarm.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well for you learned folk,” said the unpacified
boatman, “but we don’t do things after that fashion
on the river&ndash;side; and for all he’s the son of an old friend of
the Colonel’s, when he comes this way again he’s like to hear
something of my notion of his manners.”</p>

<p>“What sort of character bears he at home?”</p>

<p>“Why, to tell the truth, his character’s indifferent good; I
never heard of his bein’ rude or uncivil&ndash;like before.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, Bearskin, if he comes here again, give him an
opportunity for explaining his sudden departure, before you
take or express any offence at conduct of which you may not
rightly understand the motives. Come, my good friend, clear
your brow, and let us partake with gratitude of the excellent
cheer that you have provided.”</p>

<p>Thus saying the missionary placed himself with his companion
at table, and the ill&ndash;temper of the latter was dispelled
by the first glass of Father Antin’s cognac.</p>

<p>After this interview with Paul Müller, Ethelston pursued
the business which had brought him to St. Louis with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
vigour and energy, that at the close of a week’s negotiation he
was able to inform Colonel Brandon that by sacrificing a small
portion of the disputed claim, he had adjusted the matter upon
terms which he trusted his guardian would not consider disadvantageous;
his letter concluded thus:</p>

<p>“Having now explained these transactions, and informed
you in another letter of the melancholy fate of Mike Smith
and some of his companions, I must announce to you my intention
of setting off immediately in search of Reginald, with
the best&ndash;appointed force that I can collect here, for I am
seriously apprehensive for his safety, surrounded as he is by
roving tribes of Indians, with some of whom he and his party
are at open war; while the band of Delawares, upon whose
friendship he might have relied, is almost destroyed. As it
may be a work of some time and difficulty to find Reginald in a
region of such boundless extent, I must entreat you not to feel
uneasy on my account, should my absence be more protracted
than I would wish it to be, for I shall be accompanied by
Bearskin and other experienced trappers; and I know that
even Lucy would have no smile for me on my return, if I
came back to Mooshanne without making every exertion to
extricate her brother from the difficulties in which these unexpected
incidents have involved him.”</p>

<p>By the same post Ethelston wrote also to inform Lucy of
his resolution; and though she felt extremely vexed and
anxious on account of the lengthened absence which it foretold,
still she did him the justice in her heart to own that he
was acting as she would have wished him to act.</p>

<p>Not a day passed that he did not consult with Paul
Müller, and also with the most experienced agents of the
fur companies, in order that he might provide the articles
most requisite for his contemplated expedition, and secure
the services of men thoroughly trained and accustomed to
mountain and prairie life.</p>

<p>In this last respect he was fortunate enough to engage a man
named Pierre, a half&ndash;breed from the Upper Missouri, whose
life had been spent among the most remote trading&ndash;posts,
where his skill as a hunter, as well as in interpreting Indian
languages, was held in high estimation. Bearskin, who was
almost recovered from his wound, and from his short fit of ill&ndash;humour
with Ethelston, agreed to join the party, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
good missionary resolved to brave all dangers and fatigues
in the hope of rejoining, and perhaps of being instrumental in
rescuing, his beloved pupil.</p>

<p>With unwearied industry and exertion Ethelston was able,
in one week subsequent to the date of his letter, to leave
St. Louis in search of his friend, attended by eight hardy
and experienced men, all of whom, excepting the missionary,
were well armed, and furnished with excellent horses,
mules, and every necessary for their long and arduous undertaking.</p>

<p>Guided by Bearskin, they reached without accident or adventure
the site of the desolate Lenapé village, in the Osage
country, and there fell in with one of the young Delawares
detached by War&ndash;Eagle to observe what might be passing in
the neighbourhood: from this youth they learnt that War&ndash;Eagle
and Reginald, with a small party, had gone westward
in pursuit of Mahéga, and that the large body of the surviving
Delawares were on the trail of the more numerous band of the
treacherous Osages.</p>

<p>Ethelston wished to go on at once in search of his friend,
but the youth insisted that he should first assist his band in
taking vengeance on their enemies. Promises and threats
proved equally unavailing; and after the missionary had exhausted
all his eloquence in endeavouring to promote peace, he
was himself compelled to assure Ethelston that his only chance
of finding the trail of his friend in a spot so intersected by
multitudinous paths, was to accede to the terms proposed by
the Indian; he concluded in these words:</p>

<p>“Doubtless the conduct of these Osages was bloodthirsty
and treacherous. I cannot deny that they deserve punishment,
but I would fain have left them to the chastisement of a higher
Power; I know, however, that I cannot change the notion of
retributive justice entertained by the Indians; and although I
cannot prevent retaliation, my presence may soften the severities
by which it is usually accompanied; at all events I will
not shrink from the attempt, especially as it is the only means
by which we can possibly hope to trace those in whose safety
we are so deeply interested.”</p>

<p>Ethelston could not press any further objection; and his
party, under the guidance of the young Delaware, was soon in
rapid motion upon the trail of the larger body of the Osages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
who were, as it may be remembered, already pursued by a band
of Lenapé warriors.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the second day’s march, Ethelston
and his party met the latter returning in triumph from a
successful pursuit of their enemies, whom they had overtaken
and surprised before they could reach the main body of the
Osage village. The attack was made by night, and the Delawares
had taken many scalps without the loss of a single man;
but their number was not sufficient to justify their remaining
in the neighbourhood of a force so much superior to their own,
so they had retreated to the southward, and were now on the
way to their former village, where they intended to perform
more at leisure the funeral ceremonies due to their aged chief,
and those who had been killed with him, and to appease their
unquiet spirits by offering at their graves the trophies taken
during their late expedition. A few of the most daring and
adventurous entreated permission to join Ethelston’s band in his
search for War&ndash;Eagle, their favourite leader; nor was he by
any means sorry to grant their request, justly considering the
addition of ten well&ndash;armed Lenapé warriors as a most desirable
reinforcement to his party.</p>

<p>As soon as the selection was made, they separated at once
from the remaining body of Delawares, and, guided by the
youth before mentioned, threw themselves upon the trail of
Mahéga and his pursuers.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE OSAGES ENCAMP NEAR THE BASE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.—AN
UNEXPECTED VISITOR ARRIVES.</p>

<p class="pn">After parting with the Aricarás, Mahéga travelled westward
for many days over that barren and desolate region lying
between the sources of the Platte and Arkansas rivers, without
falling in with any other Indians: his party was guided by a
grim and scarred warrior, who had been on several hunting
excursions to the Rocky Mountains, in the course of which he
had been more than once engaged with the Shiennes, Crows,
and other tribes, whose names have of late years become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
familiar to the general reader, but who were then known only
to the few adventurous spirits who had pushed their way into
that wild and dangerous country.</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird, attended by her faithful Lita, and mounted on
her high&ndash;mettled and sure&ndash;footed pony, was placed near the
centre of the line of march, and Mahéga himself always
brought up the rear, that being the post usually occupied by
an Indian chief on all occasions, excepting when engaged in
attack or pursuit of a foe.</p>

<p>The maiden seemed to have resigned herself composedly to
her captive condition; and if she still harboured thoughts, or
projects of escape, none could detect them in the quiet observant
eye with which she noted the new and interesting objects
presented to her view. They had already passed the chain of
hills known as the Ozark range, and leaving the Black Hills to
the northward, were crossing the sandy elevated plain which
lies between them and the Rocky Mountains: the sand of this
district is of a reddish hue, and in many places the hollows
and small ravines are incrusted with salt, which gives them, at
first, the appearance of being covered with snow; large masses
of rock salt are also of frequent occurrence, and give to the
waters of all the smaller tributaries of the Upper Arkansas a
brackish and briny taste.</p>

<p>One evening, a little before sunset, Prairie&ndash;bird checked her
horse, to enjoy at leisure the magnificent panorama before her;
and even the suspicious Mahéga forbore to interrupt her enjoyment
of its beauties, contenting himself with viewing them as
reflected on her own lovely countenance. To the northward
was an abrupt crag of sandstone rock, towering above the
plain, over which the party were now travelling; its rugged
outline broken into a thousand fissures and rents, probably by
the might of a rushing torrent in bygone years, frowned like
the turrets and battlements of an ancient feudal castle, and the
maiden’s fancy (recurring to some of the tales which had found
their way into her slender library) peopled its lofty towers and
spacious courts below with a splendid host of chivalry, fairest
and foremost amongst whom was the proud and martial figure
of Reginald Brandon!</p>

<p>Brushing a teardrop from her eye, she averted it from the
castellated bluff, and turned it westward, where was spread a
gradually ascending plain, covered with cedars, pines, and rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
masses of various forest growth; far beyond which the Great
Peak, highest of the Northern Andes, reared its majestic form,
the setting sun shedding a flood of golden light upon the
eternal snow reposing on its crest. With admiring wonder,
Prairie&ndash;bird, to whom the dread magnificence of mountain
scenery was new, gazed on the mighty landscape stretched out
before her; she held her breath as the rays of the sinking sun
changed the golden fleecy haze around the distant peak to a
rosy hue, and soon again to a deeper saffron tint; and when,
at last, it disappeared behind the rocky barrier in the west,
Prairie&ndash;bird covered her eyes with her hands, as if to enjoy
over again in memory a scene of such surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she exclaimed half aloud; “many of the works of
man are wonderful, and the fictions of his fancy yet more
marvellous; even visions such as rose before my imagination,
when contemplating yon rugged craggy height; but what are
they, when compared to the living wonders of creation! Almighty
Creator—merciful Father! Thou hast led the steps
of thy feeble and helpless child to this wild and remote mountain
solitude! It is filled with Thy presence! Thou art her
protector and guide—her trust is in Thee!”</p>

<p>Mahéga gazed with awe on the maiden as, with parted lips,
and eyes upturned to the glowing western heaven, she seemed
to commune with some unseen mysterious Being; and the
other Indians, watchful of their leader’s countenance, kept at
a respectful distance until her short reverie was past, when the
party resumed their march towards the spot chosen for the
evening encampment.</p>

<p>The journey over the ascending sandy plain before mentioned,
occupied several days, at the end of which they reached
the opening of a fertile valley, sheltered on three sides by steep
ridges, well covered with wood, and watered by a clear stream:
far as the eye could reach, the plain to the southward was
studded with vast herds of buffalos grazing in undisturbed
security; the timid antelope bounded across the distant prairie;
and as the travellers entered the valley, the quick eye of Mahéga
detected on the velvet turf stretched beneath the northern
ridge, numerous tracks of the mountain deer and of the argali,
or bighorn, a species of goat, the chamois of the Rocky Mountains,
found generally among the most rugged cliffs and precipices;
to the scenery of which his long beard, bright eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and enormous twisted horn, give a wild and picturesque effect.
Mahéga was so struck with the singular advantages offered by
this valley, both as affording a sheltered camp, ample pasturage
for the horses, and a plentiful supply of game, that he resolved
to take up there his summer quarters, and in selecting the spot
for his encampment displayed the sagacity and foresight peculiar
to his character.</p>

<p>About a mile from the point where the valley opened upon
the plain, there was, at the base of the northern ridge, a curved
and secluded verdant basin of turf, the entrance to which was
so narrow and so well shaded by overhanging trees, that it was
not visible from any distance, and could not be approached on
any other side, owing to the precipitous height of the crags
by which it was surrounded; on an elevated peak or promontory,
immediately above the opening which led to this natural
lawn, grew a number of thick, massive, dwarf cedars, from under
the shade of which a clear&ndash;sighted man could command a view
of the whole valley, and give early notice, to those encamped
below, of the approach of danger. Having satisfied himself
that by posting a watchman there he could secure himself
against the unperceived attack of any foe, Mahéga left three
of his most trustworthy men in charge of Olitipa, and having
despatched the remainder of his party to kill buffalo, proceeded
to make a careful scrutiny of the valley, in order to
ascertain whether there were signs of Indians in the neighbourhood,
and whether, in the event of his being compelled to
shift his quarters, he could find any defile through which it
might be practicable to effect a retreat.</p>

<p>For three whole days he pursued his search with unremitting
toil, during which time he ascertained that there were no
visible traces of Indians being near, and that three miles
higher up the valley there was a transverse opening in the
northern ridge, which led to another and a larger valley,
through which flowed a river of considerable magnitude. In
the mean time the Osages had not been idle, and although little
pleased to perform menial services, such as are usually left to
their women, they pitched the tent of Olitipa, with much
taste, at the foot of a huge rock, and between two lofty pines;
next to it they constructed, at a distance of only a few yards,
a lodge for their chief, by stretching double piles of buffalo&ndash;hide
over bent poles, cut after their fashion; and again, beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
that, they raised a larger and ruder skin lodge for themselves;
the guitar, and the few moveables belonging to Prairie&ndash;bird
were carefully piled in her tent; and, as a watch was stationed
at the opening to the valley, she was free to wander as she
pleased among the trees which bordered the edge of the lawn
on which they were encamped.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the maiden, casting her eyes upward to the
beetling crags above, and then letting them rest upon the green
turf at her feet, “if it be God’s pleasure that I should be a
captive still, he has granted me, at least, the favour of a goodly
prison wherein to dwell.”</p>

<p>She observed with gratitude the change that had taken
place in the demeanour of Mahéga towards herself: so far
from being harsh or violent, he was respectful in the highest
degree; and, whether the change was owing to his fears, or to
more creditable motives on the part of the Osage, she followed
the advice tendered by the missionary, by treating him with
courteous gentleness. Whenever he addressed her, it was in
Delaware; and her perfect familiarity with that tongue rendered
it easy for her to make such replies as the occasion might
demand,—sometimes ambiguous, sometimes mysterious, but
always such as were not calculated to irritate or offend his
pride.</p>

<p>Venison and buffalo meat abounded in the Osage camp, the
choicest morsels being always set apart for the use of Prairie&ndash;bird;
and Lita gathered for her various kinds of berries, which
are plentiful in that region, some of them resembling the
gooseberry, the serviceberry, and others of excellent flavour;
there was also found an esculent root, called by the Indians
“<i>o&ndash;ka&ndash;no&ndash;mi</i>,” of a farinaceous quality, which the Comanche
girl had often seen on her native plains, and from which, when
she had beaten and pulverised it between two flat stones, she
baked a kind of cake, that was by no means unpalatable.</p>

<p>The Osages had now been encamped nearly a week on this
pleasant and sheltered spot, dividing their time between their
two favourite occupations of hunting and smoking: neither
had any fresh Indian trail been discovered, to arouse their
suspicion or their watchfulness. Before retiring to rest, it was
usual for Mahéga to come before the tent of Prairie&ndash;bird;
and she, aware of the helplessness of her situation, came
forth to meet him, receiving with guarded courtesy the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
compliments which he thought fit to pay her, and replying in
a tone which, although not directly encouraging to his hopes,
was calculated to soothe the irritation which her former treatment
of him, and the recollection of his unsuccessful struggle
with Reginald, had left upon his mind.</p>

<p>And here we may pause to observe how the strange contradictions
that are found in the human character frequently produce
a line of conduct which would, at first sight, appear irreconcilable
with all probability, and yet which is in strict accordance with
the secret workings of the wayward will by which it is directed.
Thus Mahéga, when he first became smitten with the beauty
of Prairie&ndash;bird in the Delaware camp, where she was surrounded
by friends and protectors, wooed her with the rough
impetuosity of his nature, and, finding his advances rejected,
he resorted, as we have seen, to brutal violence, his passion
being so much heightened by the obstacles which it encountered,
that, in order to gratify it, he provoked that quarrel
with the Delawares in which so much blood, both of his own
people and of his allies, had been already shed. Now that he
was triumphant, and felt secure of the person of his captive, a
new and ardent desire had arisen within him,—a desire to
compel her to love him. In this pursuit, also, his proud
and haughty spirit led him to anticipate success; and thus, for
a time, the darker and more malignant feelings of his bosom
slumbered undisturbed.</p>

<p>One evening, when he had held his customary talk with
Prairie&ndash;bird, he retired to his lodge, and the maiden to her
tent, where she took up her long&ndash;neglected guitar, and ran
her fingers carelessly through its strings. Lita sat by her side,
braiding the front of a pair of mocassins with stained quills of
the porcupine; and, although neither sigh nor tear betrayed
her feelings, Prairie&ndash;bird, whose heart now led her intuitively
to dive into that of her companion, saw that sad and busy
thoughts were there: the Comanche girl, proud and reserved as
she was with others, had been won, by the gentleness of her
mistress, to entertain for her an attachment, that was now
strengthened and cemented by the trials and dangers which
they had shared together. It might, indeed, be supposed that,
as both were now captives of the chief of another tribe, the
relation of distress and servant had ceased; yet Lita seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
think otherwise, and her attendance upon Prairie&ndash;bird was, if
possible, more devoted than before.</p>

<p>“For whom are you ornamenting those mocassins, Lita?”
inquired the latter, with a sad smile.</p>

<p>“For whom?” repeated Lita, casting up her dark eyes, and
fixing them on her mistress as if she would read her soul.
The tone in which the exclamation was uttered, and the look
by which it was accompanied, assured Prairie&ndash;bird that her
conjectures were well founded.</p>

<p>When the heart is full, one overflowing drop tells the contents
of the golden chalice; and from the two words spoken
by her companion, Olitipa gathered her meaning as well as if
she had replied, “Is there any other being on earth but one for
whom I can be braiding them?”</p>

<p>The voice of Prairie&ndash;bird trembled with a conscious fellow&ndash;feeling
as she said, “Lita,—I ask not to know your secret,
but I pray to the Great Spirit so to direct the steps of him
for whom those mocassins are made, that he may receive
them at your hands, and wear them for your sake!”</p>

<p>On hearing these words, a deep blush came over the face
and neck of the Comanche girl; a word of kindness had
touched a spring which, in her wild and wayward nature, would
have been unmoved by fear or by violence, and she threw
herself into the arms of Prairie&ndash;bird, giving vent to long&ndash;concealed
emotions in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she regained her composure and resumed her
braiding, when the quick ear of Prairie&ndash;bird caught the sound
of a low chirrup, like that of a grasshopper, close at the back
of the tent: she remembered to have heard that signal before;
the blood fled from her cheek, and she held her breath in
agitated silence: again the sound was repeated, and Prairie&ndash;bird
stole to the corner of the tent whence it proceeded, and
stooping her head, said, in English, “If Wingenund is
there, let him speak.”</p>

<p>“My sister!” whispered the soft voice of the youth in reply.</p>

<p>“’Tis he! ’tis my dear young brother himself!”</p>

<p>“Is all quiet, Prairie&ndash;bird?”</p>

<p>“All is quiet.”</p>

<p>“Then Wingenund will pull out one of these tent&ndash;pegs,
and creep in below the canvass,—he has much to say to his
sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the emotion caused by her brother’s sudden
appearance, and by the recollection that, if discovered, his life
would certainly be forfeited, Prairie&ndash;bird retained sufficient
presence of mind to continue passing her fingers through the
chords of her guitar, in order to drown the noise made by
Wingenund in removing the fastenings, and effecting his entrance
below the tent. At length he stood before her; and,
after gazing sadly, fondly, on his countenance for a few moments,
she fell upon his neck and wept! The figure was
indeed that of her favourite brother; but oh, how changed
since she had last seen him! Cold, wet, sleepless nights,
fatigue, and hunger, had all combined to wear and exhaust a
frame which, although cast in nature’s fairest and most graceful
mould, had not yet reached the enduring strength of manhood:
his once gay attire was soiled and ragged, the mocassins
on his feet were of undressed bison&ndash;hide, torn, and scarcely
affording any protection against the stones and thorny plants
with which that region abounds; his light bow, with a few
arrows still hung at his back, and the hunting&ndash;knife at his
girdle: this was all that remained of the gay accoutrements
with which he had been adorned in the Osage village; yet,
although the frame was emaciated, and the cheeks sunken, the
proud lustre of his eye told of a spirit unquenched by suffering,
and rising superior to the trials which had almost destroyed
its earthly tenement. Prairie&ndash;bird longed to ask a
hundred questions in a breath: how he had come? whether he
had seen or learnt any thing of War&ndash;Eagle, and of Reginald?
but affectionate compassion for her young brother’s sad condition
overcoming every other feeling, she said to him, “Dear, dear
Wingenund, you are wearied to death, sit by me and rest;
you are starved, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Wingenund has not eaten for two days,” replied the
youth, seating himself gently at his sister’s side.</p>

<p>Fortunately, more than half of the evening meal apportioned
to Prairie&ndash;bird and Lita remained untouched in the
tent, and the latter instantly set before the youth some well&ndash;cooked
cakes and bison meat, luxuries such as had not passed
his lips for many a day; and having also placed a vessel of
water within his reach, she went, with the intuitive delicacy
and sagacity of her sex, towards the opening of the tent, so as
to afford Prairie&ndash;bird an opportunity of speaking unrestrainedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
to her brother, and at the same time to secure them as far
as possible against interruption. Wingenund, with all his
heroic patience and self&ndash;denial, was a young half&ndash;starved
Indian, and the delicacies set before him vanished in a few
minutes, as if they had been placed before a famished wolf.
Prairie&ndash;bird offered him a draught of water, adding, with an
affectionate smile, “My brother, ’tis well that there is no
more meat; a full meal is dangerous after so long a fast!”</p>

<p>“It is enough,” replied the youth; “Wingenund is well
now.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, then, how you have followed to this distant
region, and whether you have seen any thing of War&ndash;Eagle,
and of—his friends?”</p>

<p>“Wingenund has seen none,” he replied; “nothing except
the trail of Mahéga, and that he would have followed to the
big salt lake, or to death.”</p>

<p>“But how has it been possible for you to pursue the trail
undiscovered, to find food, and to avoid strange Indians on the
path?”</p>

<p>“Wingenund kept far behind the Washashee; their eyes
could not reach him; he has left on every day’s trail marks
that War&ndash;Eagle will know; they will speak to him as plainly
as my sister’s Medicine&ndash;book tells her the Great Spirit’s will.
He will come soon, and his friends with him.”</p>

<p>“But my brother has not told me how he procured food on
this toilsome journey?”</p>

<p>“When the Lenapé’s heart is full he thinks little of food,”
replied the youth proudly. He added, in a more subdued
tone: “It was not easy to find meat, for the Washashee had
driven the bison from their path, and Wingenund could not
leave their trail. Twice he has met bad Indians, who tried
to kill him.”</p>

<p>“And how did he escape them, being without a horse?”
inquired Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p>“They were too many for him to fight, and he ran from
them; but being weak with hunger, one Aricará overtook him
by the waters of the Arkansas. Wingenund shot him, and,
plunging into the river, dived; and the others never found
him; but Wingenund lost his rifle, and since then he has
eaten only roots and fruit.”</p>

<p>The simple narrative of the hardships and sufferings which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
her young brother had undergone for her sake, and which his
emaciated appearance attested but too well, brought fresh tears
to the eyes of Prairie&ndash;bird; but she checked them as well as
she was able, and said, “Tell me yet one more thing; how
have you been able to reach this spot unperceived by the
Osage watchmen?”</p>

<p>“Wingenund saw from far the camp chosen by Mahéga;
he saw that he could not approach it in front; but the rocks
behind are rough and high; he made a rope of bark and grass,
climbed up the height, and let himself down from a pine&ndash;tree
above the tent; but in case he should be discovered and killed
by the Osages, he has left an arrow where War&ndash;Eagle is sure
to find it, and the arrow will show him where to come.”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear Wingenund, you are indeed a brother,” said
the maiden, deeply moved by the mingled foresight, patience,
and devotion that he had evinced. “You are, indeed, a worthy
son of the ancient people.”</p>

<p>Here she was interrupted by a shrill cry; Lita was at the
same instant thrown rudely aside by Mahéga, who rushed into
the tent, followed by two of his warriors. Wingenund sprang
to his feet; but ere he could draw the knife from his girdle he
was seized by the Osages, and his arms pinioned behind his
back.</p>

<p>Dark and louring was the frown which the angry chief
cast upon his prisoner. The Delaware youth quailed not
before it; the hour of trial had arrived, and the haughty
spirit rising within him, triumphed over all that he had undergone;
all that he knew he had yet to undergo. He drew
himself to the full height of his graceful figure; and fixing
his bright keen eye full upon Mahéga, awaited his fate in
silence.</p>

<p>“Has the cunning antelope of the Delawares run so far to
see the den of the Black Wolf?” demanded the chief, with a
contemptuous sneer. “Has the buffalo bull sent the calf on
a path that he was afraid to tread himself? Have the Lenapé
girls sent one of their number to carry wood and water for the
Washashee warriors?”</p>

<p>Mahéga paused; and on finding that his cowardly and
brutal jeers called forth no reply, nor changed a muscle on the
haughty countenance before him, his anger grew more ungovernable,
and he exclaimed in a voice of thunder, “If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
cur&ndash;dog will not bark, the whip, and the knife, and the fire
shall find him a tongue! If he wishes not to be torn in pieces
on the spot, let him say what brought him to the Osage camp,
and where he has left War&ndash;Eagle and his pale&ndash;faced friends!”</p>

<p>Neither to the threats nor the inquiries of Mahéga did Wingenund
deign to make any reply, and the enraged chief struck
him across the face with the heavy bull&ndash;hide whip suspended
from his wrist<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>; the blow was given with such force that it
laid open the youth’s cheek, and a stream of blood poured
from the cut. At the sight of this unmanly outrage, the self&ndash;control
of Prairie&ndash;bird almost gave way; but a look from her
brother recalled her to herself, and checked the impulse which
would have led to the utterance of entreaty mingled with
indignant reproach.</p>

<p>“Speak not, my sister,” said the hero boy in the Delaware
tongue; “speak not to the cowardly Washashee wolf! Waste
not your breath on one who has only courage to strike when
his enemy’s hands are tied!”</p>

<p>Mahéga fixed his eyes upon the maiden, and a sudden
thought lighted up his countenance with a gleam of malignant
triumph. Approaching close to her, he said in a stern low
whisper, “To&ndash;morrow, before the sun goes down, Olitipa becomes
the bride of Mahéga, or that boy is burnt at a slow
fire with such tortures as the Lenapé never thought of in
dreams!” So saying, he ordered the prisoner to be carefully
guarded, and left the tent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">WAR&ndash;EAGLE’S PARTY FOLLOW THE TRAIL.—A SKIRMISH AND ITS
RESULTS.—THE CHIEF UNDERTAKES A PERILOUS JOURNEY
ALONE, AND HIS COMPANIONS FIND SUFFICIENT OCCUPATION
DURING HIS ABSENCE.</p>

<p class="pn">Notwithstanding the pains that Wingenund had taken to
leave on the trail such occasional indications as might assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
War&ndash;Eagle in following it, the progress made by the latter
was much slower than might have been expected by any one
who knew the fierce desire of vengeance that burnt within
him. Several times did the impatience of Reginald Brandon
vent itself in words, which he addressed in an under&ndash;tone to
Baptiste.</p>

<p>“I fear that my Delaware brother has lost some of his
energies, in this great calamity which has befallen his tribe;
when he followed the Dahcotah trail his foot was light and
swift; now, when more than life and death may hang upon
the events of an hour, his march is heavy and slow as that of a
jaded ox.”</p>

<p>“Master Reginald,” replied the guide, “you do the War&ndash;Eagle
wrong. A trail on this hard barren region is not like
one in the prairies of Illinois or Missouri, where, in every
little bottom, there are patches of long grass on which it is
marked as plain as a high&ndash;road. We have passed to&ndash;day
several trails of strange Indians, probably Aricarás or Upsarokas<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>;
had the War&ndash;Eagle made a mistake and followed one
of these, we might have wandered several days before we
recovered our right route; watch his eye, it is bent on the
ground, not a blade of grass escapes it; he has not time for a
word, even with you.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right, Baptiste; yet I have now studied
my Delaware brother’s countenance and character for some
time. I have seen him under the influence of strong, ay of
deadly passion, and I truly wondered at his self&ndash;control; but
there seems now to be a dull heavy load upon his spirit, as if
it were overwhelmed.”</p>

<p>“Look at your feet this moment,” quoth the guide; “and
tell me if, on this hard spot, you can trace the trail on which
we are moving.”</p>

<p>“In truth I could not,” said Reginald, looking down; “I
grant our friend’s sagacity in following it, but what has that
to do with the state of his mind and temper, which we were
discussing?”</p>

<p>“More, perhaps, than you think, Master Reginald. Along
this very path the steps of Mahéga and his warriors have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
passed, the hoofs of the horse hearing Olitipa have trod it: it
is now broad daylight, yet you can see nothing; do you
wonder, then, that you cannot discern the trail of the thoughts
and purposes that travel, in the dark, over the heart of the
Delaware?”</p>

<p>“Baptiste,” said Reginald, smiling, “I knew that you
were a skilful hunter, and an experienced woodsman; but I
never before knew that you were a philosopher!”</p>

<p>“Nor I either, Master Reginald; but perhaps I may not
be one after all. What is a philosopher?”</p>

<p>This blunt question from the sturdy guide, seemed somewhat
puzzling to his young master: and the former continued,
laughing, “Well, I suppose it’s some curious kind o’ crittur
or other that we never heard of in the woods; and you don’t
seem to have met it often yourself, or you’d not find it so hard
to give a description of it!”</p>

<p>“You are right, Baptiste; it is a creature not very often
met with, either in the woods or in civilised life; but as I
have likened you to it, I am in duty bound to describe it to
you as well as I can. A philosopher is a man whose desires
are moderate, and his passions under due control; who can
trace human actions to their real motives, and effects to their
true causes; who can read the character of others without
prejudice, and study his own without self&ndash;partiality; who
can bear prosperity without pride, and adversity without repining;—such
is my idea of a philosopher: the sketch is rough,
but sufficient to give you some notion of the object in view.”</p>

<p>The guide was, silent for a few moments; he took off his
hairy cap and twirled it several times round in his bony hands,
as was his frequent custom when perplexed. At length he
replied, “Well, Master Reginald, if that be what you call a
philosopher, I’m sure War&ndash;Eagle is more like one than I am,
and perhaps you’ll not take offence if I say that he is more
like one than you are yourself: it comes natural to an Ingian
to read his neighbour’s heart, and hide what passes in his own;
and, as to governing his passions, I think you have seen enough
to convince you that, although they were as hot and wild as
was the horse which you bestride, they are now as obedient to
the bridle as Nekimi.”</p>

<p>“I grant it,” said Reginald, reining in the proud steed
alluded to in the guide’s illustration; “I grant it; and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
how earnestly our Delaware friend is now bent upon his task;
he has made a signal for the party to halt, and is stooping to
examine a blade of grass, as if life itself depended upon his
acute sagacity.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, as the young man said; the Delaware chief
had stooped to examine a bunch of grass by the side of the
trail, in which his quick glance had detected a small object
which would have escaped a less&ndash;practised eye: with a subdued
exclamation of surprise he seized it, and concealed it for
a moment in his hand, a ray of animation lighting up his fine
countenance; it was but for a moment, his features almost
immediately relapsed into their usual melancholy grave expression;
and drawing near to Reginald, he put into his hands a
small golden clasp, saying,</p>

<p>“My brother, War&ndash;Eagle knows it well; it was given by
the Black Father to Olitipa: the trail is clear as the great white
pathway of heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Reginald took the clasp, and seizing the hand which held it,
he pressed it in silence to his heart: he had marked the varying
expression on War&ndash;Eagle’s countenance; he saw how a
moment’s recollection had changed the sanguine exultation of
the lover, to the sad yet steady firmness of the friend; and
his heart yearned towards his Indian brother with an affection
that words could not express; but they were not needed; his
moistened eye and glowing cheek spoke volumes to his friend,
and War&ndash;Eagle bounded forward again upon the trail, his
spirit excited by an incident which, though slight in itself, had
called forth high and generous emotions.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the Delaware had resumed his post as
guide, our hero purposely fell into the rear of the party, and
throwing the rein loosely over the neck of his horse, turned
the precious golden relic over and over between his fingers,
and pressed it a thousand times to his lips; the ground over
which they were travelling was a broken series of ravines or
ridges, and thus he was enabled to indulge in the extravagant
endearments which he bestowed upon the senseless trinket,
without being exposed to the curious eyes of his fellow&ndash;travellers,
now out of his sight.</p>

<p>He was aroused from his reverie by a terrific yell, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
by a sharp sensation of pain; and on raising his eyes
perceived at once that he was cut off from his party by a
mounted band of Indians, one of whom had shot an arrow
through the fleshy part of his thigh, into the flap of the saddle,
where it was still sticking. Instantly deciding that it was
better to trust to the speed of Nekimi than to the desperate
chance of forcing his way through the Indians in front, he
struck the steed with his heel, and turning his head towards
the open prairie to the left of the trail, went off at full
speed, followed by several mounted warriors; his first care
was to secure the clasp within his hunting&ndash;shirt; his next to
examine the priming of his rifle, and of the pistols at his
saddle&ndash;bow; finding these all in order, he looked round at his
pursuers, who, although urging their horses by yells and
blows, did not gain upon Nekimi, even when going at an easy
gallop.</p>

<p>Re&ndash;assured by finding the advantage which he had over his
enemies in the speed of his horse, Reginald cut the arrow
where it pinned his leg to the saddle, and then, without much
pain or difficulty, drew the shaft from the flesh. Being now
satisfied that he had nothing to fear from the wound, he
turned the head of his horse in a direction parallel to the trail
on which his party had been marching, as he felt that his
ultimate safety must depend upon his not being separated from
them.</p>

<p>A loud yell followed by a succession of rifle&ndash;shots announced
to him that the attack on his friends had commenced;
and although the broken nature of the ground still prevented
him from seeing them, he could gather from the sound that
they were at no great distance; rightly judging that they
must be anxious respecting his own safety, he now applied his
bugle to his lips, and blew a clear blast, which Baptiste immediately
recognised as the concerted signal for “All’s well,”
and cheerily responded to.</p>

<p>The Indians in pursuit of Reginald reined in their horses,
and stood gazing at each other in astonishment, at sounds
which had never before reached their ear; and all, excepting
one, wheeled to rejoin the main body of their band; he who
remained was evidently a chief, or principal brave, his dress
was splendidly adorned with scalp&ndash;locks, eagle&ndash;feathers, and
beads; and instead of the shaven crown and single tuft of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
hair usually worn by the Pawnees, and other Indians of the
Platte and Missouri region, his long black hair streamed over
his shoulders, and fell upon the haunches of the wild spirited
courser on which he was mounted. When he found that the
number of his enemies was reduced to a single one, Reginald
was not of a temper to consider flight as any longer necessary;
so he checked the speed of Nekimi, and trotting to the summit
of a rising ground in front of him, saw, at a little distance,
in the ravine below, the skirmish that was still continued between
his friends and the attacking party.</p>

<p>But he was not long permitted to remain an idle spectator;
for the Indian, having recovered from the surprise occasioned
by the bugle&ndash;call, was again approaching him at full speed.
Reginald turned his horse towards his assailant, and deliberately
raising his rifle, waited until the latter should be near enough
to afford him a certain aim; but the Indian observing his
cool determined bearing, and having some experience of the
dangerous nature of the white man’s weapon, suddenly wheeled
his horse, and galloped to and fro in a zigzag direction, sometimes
advancing, sometimes retreating, with a rapidity that
left Reginald in doubt whether he were meditating an attack,
or desirous only of exhibiting his wonderful powers of horsemanship.</p>

<p>These doubts were, however, soon resolved; for in one of
these swift evolutions, when passing the spot where Reginald
stood, at a distance of fifty yards, the Indian suddenly threw
himself half off his horse, and hanging over its side, discharged
from under the animal’s neck an arrow, which whizzed
close by Reginald’s ear; then, when he was himself out of shot,
resumed his seat in the saddle, and again wheeling his horse,
prepared to repeat a man&oelig;uvre which had so nearly been attended
with success.</p>

<p>On this second occasion Reginald was resolved to try his
chance with the rifle; and when his enemy, emboldened by
the quiet and apparently surprised demeanour of the white
man, threw himself again over the side of his horse, and came
within a nearer range, our hero levelled his rifle at the animal,
whose body shielded completely that of his opponent, and the
ball taking effect behind the shoulder, both horse and man
rolled upon the grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill313" id="ill313">ill313</a></p>

<p class="pcr">P. <a href="#Page_312">312</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>Reginald sprung from his saddle and hastened to the spot,
hoping to secure the Indian while still encumbered by the
fallen horse; but the active savage leapt upon his feet, and not
having time to fit an arrow to the string, struck a furious but
unsuccessful blow at the young man’s head, with his bow;
then uttering his war&ndash;cry, rushed upon him with a long sharp
knife that he had drawn from his belt; but the Indian had
mistaken both the skill and strength of the opponent with
whom he thus rashly endeavoured to close, and in a moment
Reginald’s cutlass was buried in his chest. In vain he summoned
all his remaining strength to strike a last blow; both
hand and eye refused their aid, and he fell heavily forward
upon the grass. Reginald, sheathing his cutlass, knelt by the
side of the wounded man, and strove to stanch the blood;
but his efforts were fruitless, the lungs were pierced, and it
was evident that death was fast approaching.</p>

<p>The Indian, still conscious of what was passing around,
and momentarily expecting the scalp&ndash;knife upon his forehead,
the usual fate of the conquered amongst those of his
race, gazed in surprise upon the countenance of the young
man, who was now tending him with compassionate anxiety:
they could not interchange a word; the Indian feebly raised
his hand to his head with an inquiring look, and then pointed
to the knife. Reginald shook his head, as if to intimate that
he need be under no apprehension of that indignity; and then
continued his earnest but ineffectual endeavours to stanch
the flowing blood, while the sufferer’s head rested upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>During this time not a groan escaped from the lips of the
savage warrior: but feeling his end at hand, he gathered his
dying energies; and taking from his neck the magnificent
collar which he wore, made from the claws of a grisly bear,
bound together with skins of snow&ndash;white ermine, he gave
it to Reginald, making him a sign that he should wear it;
then supporting himself in a sitting posture by the end of
his bow, which he had caught up from the ground, and
with his eye steadily fixed upon the snow&ndash;clad peak now
visible in the western horizon, the prairie&ndash;warrior breathed his
last.</p>

<p>As soon as Reginald was assured that life was extinct, he
stretched the unconscious limbs, closed the eyes, gathered the
massive hair over the rigid countenance, and arranged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
arms and accoutrements decently beside the fallen chieftain,
knowing well that it would not be long before the body was
borne off by those of his own tribe. There was neither
exultation nor triumph on the young man’s countenance, as
he looked from the lifeless form of his late adversary to that
of the steed, which lay dead beside him, on which, not many
minutes before, he was careering over his native plains in the
pride and vigour of manhood; he felt that the strength, the
activity, the courage of the savage warrior, were equal to his
own; that it had depended upon a single successful thrust
whether of the two should be now taking his last uncoffined
sleep in the wilderness. Sad thoughts of his waiting mother
and sister, musings on the fate of Prairie&ndash;bird, stole upon his
heart, and he continued gazing almost unconsciously on the
body of the Indian, until he was aroused by a shrill blast
from the bugle of Baptiste; the signal&ndash;blast was “Beware:”
and casting his eyes around, he saw that the band of Indians
who had been skirmishing with War&ndash;Eagle’s party were
advancing at full speed to the spot where he stood. His spirit
rekindled by this fresh excitement, he caught up his rifle, and
vaulting on the back of Nekimi, gave him the rein. The
pursuers soon found that their chance of overtaking him was
hopeless; and while they gathered round the body of their
fallen chief, Reginald rejoined his party, who received him
with a shout of triumph that reached the ears of the mourners
on the far prairie.</p>

<p>As Reginald dismounted and walked gravely through the
group to salute War&ndash;Eagle, every eye was fixed upon the
bear&ndash;claw collar around his neck, and he received the silent
homage which Indian warriors pay to successful valour.</p>

<p>There was also a quiet dignified modesty in the young
man’s bearing and demeanour, which did not escape their
observant and approving eyes. “My brother is welcome,”
said War&ndash;Eagle, extending his hand to greet his friend; “he
has killed a great chief; when the warriors tell their deeds at
the war&ndash;dance, the tongue of Netis will not be silent.”</p>

<p>“The red man of the prairie was brave,” replied Reginald;
“he died like a warrior. I trust his spirit is gone to the
happy land.”</p>

<p>“Master Reginald,” said the guide, thrusting his large
bony hand into that of our hero, “it did my heart good to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
see the Ingian fall; he sprang upon you like a tiger, and I
feared he might catch you unawares.”</p>

<p>“No, Baptiste, no; he was a gallant fellow, and I am
truly sorry that, in self&ndash;defence, I was obliged to kill him;
but the advantages were all on my side; Nekimi was far
swifter than his horse, and his knife was no match for my
cutlass. Do you know to what tribe he and his party belonged?”</p>

<p>“Capote&ndash;bleu, Master Reginald—this is the first time you
have seen <i>Les Corbeaux</i>—Upsaroka they call themselves;
they are a wild race.” And he added, in a lower tone, “We
shall see more of them before we go much further.”</p>

<p>“In the skirmish which they had with you, were any
wounded on either side?”</p>

<p>“Not many, for the rascals galloped about in such an unaccountable
flurry, it wasn’t easy to make sure work with the
rifle; but the Doctor scored the ribs of one, and I think War&ndash;Eagle
struck another; they kept at a very unfamiliar distance,
and their arrows were as harmless as snow&ndash;flakes.”</p>

<p>“How fared it with Monsieur Perrot?” inquired Reginald,
who saw the light&ndash;hearted valet grinning with satisfaction at
his master’s victory and safe return, “did he not try his skill
upon any of these marauding Crows?”</p>

<p>“Well, I hardly know,” said the guide. “Master Perrot
is like the bear in the tree, he fights very well when he can’t
help it; but I conceive he’s not over fond of the red&ndash;skins
ever since that Dahcotah handled his wig so roughly! What
say you, Monsieur Perrot?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Baptiste is not altogether wrong,” replied the
good&ndash;humoured valet; “if one of those red Corbeaux come
very near to peck me, I do my best to pluck his feathers out;
but I much rather see a fat partridge or capon than one of
them!”</p>

<p>The conversation between the Frenchman and the guide
was interrupted by War&ndash;Eagle, who made a sign to the latter,
as well as to Reginald, that he wished to speak with them
apart.</p>

<p>“Brother,” said the chief, addressing our hero, “the Upsarokas
are many; their warriors are like the bison&ndash;herds;
they will soon return to our path, we must be ready for them.
What is my brother’s counsel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>“Baptiste,” said the young man, “you have more experience
in these matters than I have; speak first.”</p>

<p>The guide did not reply immediately; he bent his eyes
upon the ground, and his fingers rested on the head of the
massive hatchet from whence he derived his Indian name.
When he spoke, it was with slow but decisive enunciation.
“War&ndash;Eagle has spoken truly, the Crows will return in
greater numbers; they will seek revenge for the death of their
chief; they are brave, but their arms are bad—we are few,
but our weapons can do service. My counsel is, that we choose
a strong camp and await their coming; we will then handle
them so that they shall not desire to interrupt us again; or
perhaps they may offer to make a treaty upon our own terms.”</p>

<p>“The words of Grande&ndash;Hâche are wise,” rejoined the
chief; “he does not waste his breath in blowing against the
wind. What says my brother Netis?”</p>

<p>“He says,” replied Reginald, with his characteristic impetuosity,
“that the counsel of Grande&ndash;Hâche may be good for
our own safety, but it will not bring us nearer to Mahéga.
Netis would follow the Osage trail in spite of all the Crows
between the Platte and the Mountains.”</p>

<p>“My brother speaks like a warrior without fear,” said the
chief in reply; “yet we cannot follow the trail of the Washashee
while fighting by day and by night with the Upsaroka.
War&ndash;Eagle will join the counsel of Grande&ndash;Hâche to that of
Netis. Let us choose a strong camp, bring in plenty of meat,
and prepare to receive the Upsaroka. I will steal away alone
in the night. I will follow the trail of Mahéga, and return to
tell my brother what I have seen. It is enough, I have
spoken.”</p>

<p>Both the guide and Reginald approved the chief’s decision;
and although our hero would rather have accompanied
him on the trail, he felt that he would impede the progress of
his Indian brother, whose fleetness of foot was so much greater
than his own; he therefore acquiesced with cheerfulness, and
they set forward to select a camp that should unite the advantages
of a defensible position to those of a plentiful supply of
water.</p>

<p>For several hours War&ndash;Eagle pursued the Osage trail without
halting, but his keen eye roved occasionally from side to
side in search of a spot favourable for encampment, while Reginald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and Baptiste brought up the rear of the party; the
former mounted on Nekimi, prepared to gallop forward to the
front and give the alarm, in case of the re&ndash;appearance of the
marauding Crows. About an hour before sunset they reached
a valley watered by a small stream, the taste of which proved
refreshing, and free from the salt with which that region
abounds; near the centre of the valley was a thick copse
of alder and willow, covering a space of fifty or sixty yards
square. On forcing his way through the outer bushes,
War&ndash;Eagle found an open plot of fine level turf, entirely
surrounded by the copse which sheltered it from view on all
sides.</p>

<p>The Delaware, having brought his party into this natural
encampment, and picqueted the horses within the space above
mentioned, made a careful examination of the thicket, in which
he was accompanied by Reginald and Baptiste; they then
selected the points from which they could best command the
approaches from different quarters; at these they piled logs
and branches matted with grass and turf, from behind which
secure though slight breastwork they could take deliberate
aim at any hostile party approaching from the prairie. Before
dusk their preparations were complete; the watch was set,
and the remainder, after a frugal supper, forgot the fatigues
of the day in sleep.</p>

<p>The night passed without the occurrence of any alarm; and
an hour before daylight War&ndash;Eagle arose and prepared himself
for his perilous expedition, after the ancient fashion of his
tribe; a fashion which the Delawares, in common with most
of the semi&ndash;civilised Indians, have in these modern days neglected,
if not forgotten.</p>

<p>Having smeared himself from head to foot with an ointment
made from the fat and marrow of deer, he painted his
face and chest with stripes of a dark colour, purposely making
the form and device to resemble those of the Missourian nations.
He wore upon his legs a light pair of deer&ndash;skin leggins,
without ornament, supported at the waist by his belt; from
the latter was suspended on one side his tomahawk, on the other
his knife; he also stuck into it a brace of loaded pistols given
to him by Reginald, and within the folds secured some bullets
and charges of powder, as well as a few slices of dried buffalo&ndash;meat:
his throat, chest, and arms were naked, with the exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
of a small light blanket, which, when thrown across his
shoulder, did not in the least impede the free exercise either
of his hands or feet. As speed was now his chief object, he
left both his rifle and his heavy war&ndash;club in the charge of
Reginald, who looked on with mingled feelings of admiration
and envy, while his friend was preparing for his solitary journey.
Knowing that War&ndash;Eagle, if successful in his undertaking,
would see the Prairie&ndash;bird, he longed to send by him
a thousand messages of love; yet he remembered and respected
the feelings of his friend, and, controlling his own, embraced
him in silence.</p>

<p>As War&ndash;Eagle was about to depart, Reginald was surprised
at seeing him attach to his belt a small bunch of feathers,
carefully tied together, and he imagined that they might be in
some measure connected with his Indian brother’s totem, or
heraldic designation; but the latter resolved his doubts by saying
to him and to Baptiste,</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle will follow the trail of Washashee as swiftly
as his feet can run: whenever it is difficult to find, or divides
in a fork, he will stick one of these small feathers in the grass;
let ‘Attō’ follow first on the trail, he has been often on the
war&ndash;path, and his eyes are good; Grande&ndash;Hâche with his long
rifle should come next: let my brother go last with Nekimi,
and let him always have eyes in his back; the Upsarokas are
cunning, and the wives of a dead chief are lamenting. If
War&ndash;Eagle lives, he will return quick and meet his brothers
on the trail; if he is killed, he will meet them afterwards in
the fields where his fathers hunt. Farewell.” So saying, the
Delaware chief pointed impressively to the distant ridge of the
mountains, and left the encampment.</p>

<p>After the departure of War&ndash;Eagle, Reginald busied himself,
with the aid of Baptiste in making further preparations
against the expected attack. On inquiring of the latter, he
learnt, with much satisfaction, that Attō or A&ndash;tō (<i>Anglicè</i>,
“The Deer”), who had been designated by the chief as
leader on the trail in his absence, was a tried and experienced
warrior. His appearance, indeed, was not much in his favour,
for he was small and spare in stature, and his features, though
not positively ugly, were stern, and rarely lighted up by expression;
his eye was piercing rather than brilliant; and he
scarcely ever spoke, excepting in reply to a question: his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
swiftness of foot, which was almost equal to that of War&ndash;Eagle
himself, had procured for him the appellation by which
he was known in the tribe. It should however, in justice to
him, be mentioned, that he seldom ran <i>from</i> an enemy, for
his courage was proverbial; and in a former expedition against
the Dahcotahs, he had made several escapes so extraordinary,
that his comrades had given him a name consisting of sixteen
or seventeen syllables, which we will not inflict upon civilised
eyes or ears, but which signifies, “The&ndash;man&ndash;who&ndash;cannot&ndash;be&ndash;killed&ndash;by&ndash;an&ndash;arrow.”</p>

<p>Reginald, finding that Attō was familiar with the English
tongue, and desirous to be on good terms with his new officer,
addressed him as follows:—</p>

<p>“Does Attō think that the Upsaroka will come to&ndash;day?”</p>

<p>“They will come.”</p>

<p>“Will they attack us in this position?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps; the Upsarokas are fools—they do not know
the Lenapé.”</p>

<p>“Are you satisfied with the arrangements we have made
for the defence?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but you should let the horses feed outside, with a
guard, or they will soon eat up the grass within; it will be
time enough to drive them in when the Upsaroka come.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Reginald, frankly, and he ordered it
to be done immediately.</p>

<p>Savages are extremely like ourselves in all that concerns the
internal workings of self&ndash;respect; and if Reginald already
stood high in Attō’s opinion for his courage and bodily advantages,
the Indian was disposed to think more highly of him
when he found, even in a matter so trifling, that the young
man listened to and followed his counsel.</p>

<p>The forenoon passed without any tidings of the Crows; and
Reginald, impatient of a state of inaction, resolved to sally
forth upon Nekimi, and to make a sweep over the adjacent
undulating prairie, to see whether he could discover any signs
of them.</p>

<p>Armed with his knife, pistols, and cutlass, he slung his spy&ndash;glass
over his shoulder, and vaulted on the back of his favourite,
charging Baptiste and Attō, now left in joint command of
the garrison, to keep a sharp look&ndash;out, and promising to return
before dusk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>How did his blood dance with excitement as he found himself
trotting briskly across the virgin turf of that wild, boundless,
vegetable ocean; beneath him a steed, bold, eager, joyous
as himself; above him a blue immensity of unclouded sky;
and around him breezes fresh from the snowy chambers of the
Northern Andes! Nor were the sources of excitement from
within wanting to complete its measure,—a consciousness of
youth, and health, and strength; a mind capable of appreciating
the wonders of nature, and of following them up to
their Almighty Framer; a heart filled to overflowing with the
image of a kindred being whose love he doubted not, and
whom, in spite of dangers and obstacles, his ardent and sanguine
spirit whispered that he would soon rejoin!</p>

<p>Again and again did he draw from his bosom the precious
clasp, which assured him that he was following her footsteps;
and then replacing it, he would stoop over the neck of Nekimi,
and caressing his playful ear, and gently pressing his flank,
the noble creature caracoled, neighed, and bounded beneath
him, like the “wild and wanton herd” described in one of
the most exquisite scenes depicted by our immortal dramatist.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the excited flow of his spirits, Reginald
did not forget the object of his excursion: he not only noted
carefully the various remarkable features of the surrounding
country, so as to secure, in case of need, his retreat to the encampment,
but he scanned the side of every hill, and the bosom
of every valley that he passed, to see whether any parties of
the Upsaroka were yet within view.</p>

<p>He had ridden many miles without seeing any thing alive,
except a few straggling buffalos and antelopes, and was on the
point of returning towards the camp, when he descried some
moving body on the sky&ndash;line in the eastern horizon: throwing
himself from his horse, he adjusted his telescope, and fixing
it on the object, ascertained at once that it was a large
party of Indians on horseback. Although his glass was of
excellent quality, they were so distant that he could not count
them, but he was satisfied that they considerably exceeded a
hundred. Observing that their course was directed westward,
he was able, by descending an oblique ravine, to reach the
edge of a copse which they were likely to pass at no great distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
whence, himself unseen, he might watch their movements,
and form a more accurate estimate of their force.</p>

<p>He had not been long stationed at the post which he had
selected for this purpose, when the band came full in view on
the ridge of a neighbouring hill.</p>

<p>That it was a war&ndash;party of the Crows he could no longer
doubt, as their dress and appearance were precisely the same,
and they were following, with the faultless sagacity of a pack
of blood&ndash;hounds, the trail which he and his companions had
trodden on the preceding day.</p>

<p>Being completely sheltered from their view by the copse, he
was able to observe their movements, and to plan his own
accordingly; he counted upwards of two hundred and fifty
mounted warriors; and his impression was that their numbers
amounted in all to nearly three hundred: they moved forward
upon the trail at an even pace until they reached the brow of
the hill, whence they could perceive, although at a considerable
distance, the thicket in which the Delawares were encamped.
Pausing here, they held a brief council: it was clear
that they suspected that the above&ndash;named wood contained those
of whom they were in pursuit; nor was it long before their
lynx eyes detected a slight column of smoke curling up above
the trees, on seeing which they shouted aloud, while their
rapid and vehement gesticulations sufficiently explained to
Reginald the discovery that they had made.</p>

<p>It was evidently not the present intention of the Crows to
make an open attack; for they now divided their force into
two bands, each of which pursued its course along the back of
the ridges which crowned the valley wherein the encampment
lay, and thus they would be enabled to reach a point not far
distant from their enemy on opposite sides, before their approach
could be perceived.</p>

<p>The position of Reginald himself was now critical, for in
his eagerness to watch the motions of the Indians, he had
allowed them to get between him and his own party; it only
remained for him, therefore, to decide whether he should
endeavour to reach the camp unperceived, or, trusting to the
speed of Nekimi, ride boldly towards it; he chose the latter,
rightly judging the impossibility of escaping Indian eyes in
so open a country; and he thought it also probable, that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
they meditated a night attack upon the encampment, they would
permit him to enter it without showing themselves.</p>

<p>Having therefore examined the priming of his pistols, and
loosened his cutlass in the sheath, he pushed his way through
the thicket, and, emerging on the opposite side, rode deliberately
forward.</p>

<p>Choosing the most open ground, he pursued his homeward
way down the valley; and though his eye glanced occasionally
to the hills on each side, not an Indian was to be seen, and in
less than an hour he found himself again within the precincts
of the wooded camp.</p>

<p>The gravity of his demeanour, as he joined his companions,
led them to conjecture that he had seen some trace of their
enemies, which impression was confirmed amongst them when
he led Baptiste and Attō aside to hold with them a council of
war.</p>

<p>Having briefly detailed what he had seen, he expressed his
belief that the Crows had divided their force for the purpose
of attacking the camp in the course of the ensuing night, and
concluded by asking their opinion as to the most advisable
means of defence. After a short deliberation, it was agreed
that four men should watch at the opposite sides of the thicket,
each of whom being well sheltered behind a log of wood
already rolled to its edge, could detect the approach of an
enemy from the prairie, and that each should be provided
with two loaded rifles, so that in case of his being obliged to
fire one to give the alarm, he might still have another ready
for immediate use.</p>

<p>These preparations having been made, and the horses
brought within the encampment, the little party sat down to
their supper, and afterwards smoked their pipes as unconcernedly
as if neither Crows nor danger were lurking in the
neighbourhood. Night came on, and those whose turn it was
to sleep, announced by their heavy breathing that the hour of
rest was not unwelcome. Monsieur Perrot snored so loudly
from beneath the pile of blankets in which he had enveloped
himself, that he more than once received a slight admonition
from the elbow of the half&ndash;awakened guide, who lay beside
him. Reginald, however, was in a mood which would have
no fellowship with sleep; his thoughts were of Prairie&ndash;bird,
still in Mahéga’s power, of his Indian brother, now far on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
solitary and dangerous journey, of the lurking foes whose
attack he hourly expected, and of the familiar faces at Mooshanne,
whom distance and absence now rendered doubly dear.
The night was dark, for the young moon, after traversing her
appointed section of the southern sky, had disappeared, and
the twinkling stars threw but an uncertain light, rendered yet
more doubtful by the leafy branches which waved gently to
and fro under the light breath of the night breeze.</p>

<p>In order to give some employment to his unquiet spirit,
Reginald resolved to visit the several stations where his sentries
were posted, and, throwing his rifle over his shoulder, arose
and commenced his rounds. Moving with a slow and noiseless
step, he went to each of the posts in succession, and finding
all the watchmen on the alert, whispered to each a word
of approbation. The last station that he visited was occupied
by Attō; and Reginald, sitting down behind the log, conversed
with him for a short time, in a low tone of voice, each pausing
at intervals, to listen and look out upon the valley. On a
sudden, Attō, touching his arm, pointed to a spot near the
summit of the neighbouring hill; and, following the direction
indicated, Reginald could plainly see a small light, as of a dry
stick, which burnt for a few seconds, and was then extinguished.</p>

<p>“Let Netis watch,” whispered the Indian; “Attō will
return directly;” and with these words he disappeared in the
thicket.</p>

<p>Not many minutes elapsed ere he came back, and, in the
same subdued tone, said, “All is well now, the Upsaroka are
coming, Attō saw the same light on the other hill; it is a
sign for both parties to attack from opposite sides at once.”</p>

<p>“All is well, indeed,” thought Reginald, within himself.
“This fellow must have a strange stomach for fighting, when
he applies such a term to an expected conflict, where the
odds are to be two or three hundred to ten.”</p>

<p>These were Reginald’s thoughts for a moment; but his
words were: “Baptiste, Perrot, and I will remain at this
post; you can spare us also one of your warriors; you will
guard the opposite post with three others; there will remain
one to move constantly round within the edge of the thicket,
to summon us to any point where the Crows may threaten an
attack. Is the plan good, what says my brother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is good,” replied the Indian, and they set about it
forthwith in earnest and in silence.</p>

<p>Reginald and Baptiste, having previously examined all the
logs which were now to serve for their defence, lost no time
in selecting their respective stations; the Indian warrior allotted
to them was placed between them; Monsieur Perrot, safely
ensconced behind the fallen trunk of an alder, was to load his
master’s rifle, and when discharged, to replace it by another;
and the defenders of the camp were all instructed not
to fire until their enemies were so near as to afford a certain
aim.</p>

<p>The side on which Reginald was stationed was the most
open to attack, from its being adjacent to the brook that flowed
through the centre of the valley, the banks of which, being
dotted here and there with alder&ndash;bushes, afforded an occasional
covert to an approaching enemy. Nearly an hour had elapsed,
and Reginald began to suspect that they had mistaken the
intentions of the Upsaroka, when Baptiste pointed in silence
towards the prairie, and on following with his eye the direction
of his companion’s finger, he saw a dusky object in motion.
Looking steadily forward, each with his finger on the
trigger of his rifle, Reginald and Baptiste could now distinguish
the figures of several Indians, creeping along the ground towards
the thicket. On a sudden the report of Attō’s rifle in
the opposite quarter was heard, and the creeping figures starting
up, advanced with shouts and yells, vainly hoping that the
spot which they had selected for attack was defenceless. When
they were within a few paces, Reginald and Baptiste fired at
once, and the two leading Indians fell; most of their companions
retired in dismay, one only sprung forward with
desperate courage, and his evil destiny bringing him close past
the log behind which the guide was posted, the latter cleft
the skull of the unfortunate savage with his tremendous
hatchet.</p>

<p>Maddened by disappointment, and by the loss of several of
their comrades, the Crows let fly a shower of arrows at the
edge of the thicket, and retreated on all sides, filling the air
with their cries and yells. Reginald, having crossed over to
visit Attō at his post, found that the Delaware had not fired
in vain, for a reeking scalp already hung at his belt, and it
appeared that the enemy had retired on this side also, as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
as they found themselves exposed to the murderous fire of
unseen marksmen.</p>

<p>Not long after this unsuccessful attack on the part of the
Upsarokas, day broke, and having mounted their horses, which
had been left at some distance, they returned towards the
encampment; and galloping to and fro, endeavoured, by every
kind of insulting gesticulation, to induce their cautious enemies
to come forth, or at least to exhaust their ammunition by firing
at random; but Reginald’s party kept close within their covert,
taking no notice whatever of these bravadoes, although several
of the horsemen came within a distance which would have
rendered them an easy mark for the guide’s unerring rifle;
their insolence produced only a grim smile on his weather&ndash;beaten
countenance, as he whispered to Reginald.</p>

<p>“They are somewhat out of their reckoning as to the
‘Doctor’s’ range; poor devils, if they’ll only keep off, I don’t
want to hurt any more of them. But if that long&ndash;haired
fellow, capering on a brown horse, were a Dahcotah, I’d make
a hole in his hunting&ndash;shirt before he was many minutes older.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to find you in a merciful humour, Baptiste,”
replied the young man. “I too would willingly avoid farther
slaughter of these Crows; and while fighting with them, we
are losing time more precious to me than gold.”</p>

<p>As he was yet speaking, his attention was caught by the
sound of a scuffle within the thicket, followed by a shout; and
immediately afterwards Attō and another Delaware came forward,
dragging with them a Crow, whom the quick eye of the
former had detected lurking under dense foliage of an alder&ndash;bush.</p>

<p>“Whom have you here?” exclaimed Reginald; “and where
did you find him?”</p>

<p>“Upsaroka,” replied Attō; “he must have crept like a
snake under the grass, for the Delawares are not blind, yet he
is here.”</p>

<p>The prisoner was a tall bold&ndash;looking youth, and he seemed
resolutely prepared to meet the fate which a spy and an enemy
must expect in that wild region.</p>

<p>“’Tis a fine lad,” said Baptiste dryly, “and he has given
us a lesson to keep a better look out; ’tis clear that he has
crept down the brook, while we have been watching those galloping
thieves; tie the rogue’s hands, my friend Attō, and let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
us scour the thicket from one end to the other. Two or three
such as him within the camp in the middle of the night,
would be apt to interfere with our rest.”</p>

<p>The prisoner having been bound, Attō proceeded with two
of his warriors to search every corner of the thicket, while
Baptiste with the remainder watched the various parties of
horsemen who were still hovering at a distance.</p>

<p>Reginald was left for a few minutes alone with the youth,
whom he looked at with mingled compassion and admiration,
for it was clear that he had devoted his own life to obtain a
triumph for his tribe; and although he had not the expressive
intellectual beauty of Wingenund, nor the heroic stamp of
form and feature by which War&ndash;Eagle was distinguished, yet
there was a certain wild fierceness in his eye betokening a
spirit that awakened a feeling of sympathy in Reginald’s breast.
While looking steadfastly on the youth under the influence of
these feelings, he observed that the Delawares, in their hurried
anxiety to secure the prisoner, had bound the thongs so tightly
round his arms as to cause a stoppage of the blood, the veins
around the ligature being already swollen to a painful extent.</p>

<p>With the unhesitating generosity of his nature, Reginald
stepped forward, and, loosening the thong, left the youth at
liberty; at the same time he smiled, and, pointing to the knife
in his belt, made the sign of “No,” intimating that he should
not repay this benefit by using that weapon.</p>

<p>The quick&ndash;sighted savage understood him as plainly as if
the hint had been given in his own language, for he instantly
detached the knife from his belt and presented it to Reginald.
There was so much natural dignity and sincerity in his manner
while doing so, that our hero, in receiving his weapon,
gave him in exchange a spare knife that hung in his own belt,
making at the same time the Indian sign for friendship.</p>

<p>The nerves which were strung to endure expected torture
and a lingering death, were not prepared for this unlooked&ndash;for
clemency; the youth spoke a few soft words in his own tongue,
looking earnestly in Reginald’s face, and had not yet recovered
his self&ndash;possession, when Attō returned with his companions,
to report that the prisoner must have come upon this dangerous
war&ndash;path alone, as no other of his tribe was lurking in or near
the thicket.</p>

<p>“Attō,” said Reginald, addressing the Delaware; “this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
youth belongs by right to the hand that took him, he is yours;
I ask you to give him to me, to do with him as I like.”</p>

<p>“The hand and the heart of Attō are both open to Netis;
he is brother to the war&ndash;chief of the Lenapé—Attō is glad
to give him what he asks.”</p>

<p>“Attō is a brave man,” replied Reginald, “and worthy of
his race; he can see that this youth is on his first war&ndash;path;
he came to the camp to make himself a name; if the quick eye
of Attō had not found him, there would have been a war&ndash;cry
in the night—is it not so, brothers?”</p>

<p>The Delawares gave their usual exclamation of assent.</p>

<p>“Brothers,” continued Reginald, “Attō has given this
youth to me—I thank him: the hand of Netis is not shut, it
holds a collar which hung upon the neck of a great warrior, it
will not be ashamed to hang on the neck of Attō.”</p>

<p>As he said this, he threw over the neck of the Delaware the
magnificent bear&ndash;claw collar which adorned his own. This
was perhaps the happiest moment of Attō’s life, for such a
collar could be worn only by braves of the highest rank in
Indian aristocracy, and the acclamation with which his comrades
hailed the presentation of the gift, assured Reginald that
it had been neither unwisely nor unworthily bestowed.</p>

<p>The latter then turned towards the prisoner, and made him
a sign to follow towards the outer edge of the thicket, in the
direction where Baptiste and he had shot the two Indians who
led the attack; their bodies still lay where they fell; the
youth gazed upon them with stern composure. Reginald inquired
by a sign if he knew them: he replied in the affirmative;
and he added, pointing to the nearer of the two, a sign which
Reginald did not comprehend; he turned to Attō for an explanation.</p>

<p>“He says,” replied the Delaware, “that was his father.”</p>

<p>Reginald, much affected, placed the youth’s hand against his
own breast in token of regard, and made him understand that
he was free to go himself, and to remove the bodies without
interruption.</p>

<p>The young Crow replied by a look of gratitude too expressive
to require the interpretation of language, and moving
towards the body of his father, bore it into the midst of his
wondering companions, who received him with repeated
wailings and cries: none, however, seemed disposed to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
in his assurance that they might take away the other body
likewise; he was obliged to return himself: and then one of
his tribe, seeing that he stood uninjured beside it, came out
from their ranks and assisted him to bear it off.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.—REGINALD PREPARES TO FOLLOW THE
TRAIL.</p>

<p class="pn">For two days the band of Crows hovered round the encampment,
sometimes showing themselves on the adjacent heights,
at others drawing off to a distance, in hopes of enticing some
of Reginald’s party to venture into the open country; but
although he himself chafed and fretted like an impatient steed,
he was sensible of the risk that must attend any error or imprudence
while in the neighbourhood of an enemy so crafty
and so strong in numbers, and he never permitted the watchfulness
of his little garrison to be relaxed for a moment: the
horses were driven to feed under the guard of two armed Delawares,
and were not sent to a distance whence their return
could be intercepted, and the watches were regularly set and
relieved during the whole night.</p>

<p>On the third day the Crows, finding that all their endeavours
to draw their cautious enemy from the covert were
vain, held a council of war, after which three or four of their
principal chiefs approached the encampment, making, as they
advanced, signs of amity and truce. Reginald went out to
meet them, accompanied by Baptiste and Attō, leaving orders
with the remainder of his party to hold themselves in readiness
against any attempt at treachery: halting at a spot not
more than eighty yards from the wood, he awaited the Crow
leaders, who came forward to meet him without any apparent
suspicion or treacherous design.</p>

<p>They had taken the precaution to bring with them the
youth to whom Reginald had already shown kindness, and
whose presence they rightly conjectured would facilitate the
amicable nature of their mission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>Reginald acknowledged with a smile the friendly greeting
of his young protégé, and then drawing himself up to his full
height, awaited in silence the opening of the parley.</p>

<p>The Crow <i>partisan</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> first glanced his keen eye over the
persons of those whom he was about to address, as if scanning
them for the purpose of ascertaining their qualities and character,
and whether he should best succeed by endeavouring
to circumvent or to overawe them. Keen as he was, his penetration
was here at fault; for although no three persons could
be more dissimilar than those before him, yet, whether taken
collectively or severally, they looked like men who would not
be easily over&ndash;reached: his eye first rested on the spare
sinewy frame and impenetrable countenance of Attō; thence
it glanced to the muscular frame and shrewd hard features of
the guide; and turning from them, it found but little encouragement
in the bright bold eye and commanding form of Reginald
Brandon.</p>

<p>Perceiving with the intuitive sagacity of an Indian that
the latter was the leader of his party, the partisan opened the
parley by pointing his forefinger at Reginald, and then pressing
the closed fingers against his own breast: he then pointed
to himself with the same finger, and afterwards stretching
both arms horizontally, moved them up and down with a
vibrating motion, concluding his pantomime by again raising
the forefinger of his right hand vertically to the height of his
forehead. Reginald, who could not understand these gestures,
turned to Attō, saying, “Does my brother know what the
stranger speaks?—if so, let him explain.”</p>

<p>“He says,” replied the Delaware, “that he wishes to be
friends with you, and he tells you by the last signs that he is
an Upsaroka, and a chief.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Reginald, “that if his heart is true, and
his tongue not forked, we also wish to be friends with him and
his people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>The Crow replied by making the conventional sign for
“good,” adding to it that for “truth.”</p>

<p>On this being explained to Reginald, the latter desired Baptiste
to bring from the camp some tobacco, a pipe, and a few
trinkets for distribution among the Crows. On the return of
the guide, the whole party took their seats, Reginald placing
the partisan on his right, and the young prisoner whom he
had released on his left. After the pipe had been smoked with
due gravity and decorum, he divided among his guests some
beads and other fanciful ornaments, according to their rank,
with which they seemed highly delighted; the chief in particular
testified his satisfaction by repeated gesticulations of
friendship and affection towards his white&ndash;brother, whom he
invited to go and feast with him and his braves: this invitation
Reginald begged leave to decline; but he desired Attō to explain
to his guest that he would visit him on some other
occasion.</p>

<p>While these civilities were passing between the respective
parties, a great commotion was observed among the Crows
stationed on the neighbouring hill, some of whom were seen
galloping to and fro, as if communicating some unexpected
intelligence. The partisan arose, and took his leave with
courteous dignity, explaining by signs that he wished to ascertain
what was passing among his people.</p>

<p>As he withdrew, the youth whose life Reginald had spared,
turned his head and gave the latter a look which he understood
to convey a warning, but it was so rapid that he could not feel
assured that he had rightly construed its meaning. Reginald
remained for some time on the spot watching the motions of
the Crows, who had now gathered in their scattered horsemen,
and were evidently awaiting with some impatience the return
of their chief. Reginald’s eye was still fixed upon them,
when Attō, pointing to the eastward, whispered,</p>

<p>“Men are coming!”</p>

<p>Turning his head in the direction indicated, Reginald
thought he perceived a moving object in the distance.</p>

<p>“I see something in that quarter, but not distinctly; are
you sure it is a party of men?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Mounted, or on foot?”</p>

<p>“Both,” replied the Delaware, without removing his bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
keen eye from the object: “they are upon our trail,” he
added; “if they are not friends, we had better return to the
camp.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Reginald unslung his telescope, and having at
length brought it to bear upon the advancing party, he exclaimed—</p>

<p>“By Heaven! there are white men as well as Indians, their
horses, and loaded mules!”</p>

<p>“How many?” inquired Baptiste.</p>

<p>“They seem to me to be fifteen or twenty strong: should
their intentions appear suspicious, we are near enough to retire
into our camp; if they are friends, they will soon see us, and
approach without fear or hesitation.”</p>

<p>The guide shook his head as if distrusting all new comers
in that remote region; but they were within rifle&ndash;shot of the
covert, and could, if necessary, retire thither under the protection
of the fire of those within it.</p>

<p>The Crows still hovered upon the summit of the adjoining
hill, and several minutes of breathless interest elapsed ere the
approaching band emerged from a hollow, upon a point of the
valley where they were now clearly distinguishable, and proved
to be, as Reginald had said, a mixed party of Indians and
white men.</p>

<p>He was not aware that among the latter was a telescope as
good, and a horseman whose eye was more practised in the use
of it than his own; that horseman galloped out in front of his
band, and advanced at full speed to the spot where Reginald
stood, and almost before the latter could rightly use his faculties
of sight or speech, that horseman flung himself from his
horse, and Reginald was in the arms of Ethelston.</p>

<p>There is nothing that stirs the heart to its very depths,
more than the meeting of a friend after a long separation; not
such a friend as is found in the ordinary intercourse of worldly
society, but a friend whom we really esteem and love, a friend
whom we have learnt to cherish in our bosom’s core,—this
must have been felt by all (alas! they are not very many)
who have deserved and obtained such a blessing in life. How,
then, must these stirrings of the heart be increased if such a
friend comes to our aid and comfort when we thought him
thousands of miles distant, when we are in anxiety and peril,
when he brings us the latest tidings of our home! We will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
not attempt to describe the meeting of the two long&ndash;separated
and loving friends under such circumstances, nor to relate one
hundredth part of the inquiries which each had to make and to
reply to.</p>

<p>The reader is already in possession of the information which
they had to communicate to each other, and can easily understand
how Ethelston and his party, guided by the young Delaware,
had followed the trail on which they had been preceded
by the bands of Mahéga and of Reginald: the latter greeted
with cordial pleasure Paul Müller, who now advanced to offer
him his friendly salutation, while Pierre Baptiste, and Bearskin,
who had weathered many a stormy day by flood and field
together, interchanged the grasp of their horny hands with
undisguised satisfaction.</p>

<p>In the meeting between the two bands of the Delawares
there was less demonstration, but it may be doubted whether
there was less excitement, as the last comers narrated to their
comrades the bloody vengeance which they had taken on some
of their foes, and dilated upon that which they anticipated in
pursuit of Mahéga.</p>

<p>Ethelston’s party being provided with some coffee, sugar,
biscuits, and other luxuries, which had been long strange to
Reginald’s camp, the evening of their arrival was devoted to a
great merry&ndash;making, Monsieur Perrot undertaking the office of
chief cook and master of the ceremonies, both of which he
executed with so much skill and good&ndash;humour as to win the
favour of all present. In the midst of the feasting, the security
of the encampment was never endangered by the omission of
due precautions; for the horses were driven in and the sentries
posted, as on the preceding night, Reginald being well aware
of the treacherous character of his Crow neighbours, and his
suspicions aroused by the slight, but significant look given to
him at parting by the youth whose life he had spared.</p>

<p>While they were seated round a blazing fire enjoying the
good cheer which Perrot had provided, Pierre, fixing his eyes
upon the bear&ndash;claw collar worn by Attō, uttered an exclamation
of surprise, and springing from his seat, went to examine
it closer; having done so, he pronounced slowly and with emphasis
a name as long as a Sanscrit patronymic.</p>

<p>“What does that mean, Pierre?” inquired Ethelston, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
had found in the latter a guide of great shrewdness and experience.</p>

<p>“It is the name of the Upsaroka to whom that collar belonged,
in our tongue, ‘The man whose path is red.’ I saw
it upon his neck last year, when I was at the post near the
Upper Forks. He came to trade with us for a few knives and
blankets—he was a great war&ndash;chief, and had killed more
Black&ndash;feet than any man in his tribe.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pierre, his own turn has come now; he will kill no
more Black&ndash;feet, nor white men either,” said Baptiste to his
comrade.</p>

<p>“Did yonder Lenapé kill him, and in fair fight, man to
man?”</p>

<p>“He was killed in fair fight, man to man; not by Attō,
but by a young war&ndash;chief whom the Lenapé call Netis,” replied
the guide.</p>

<p>Pierre fixed his quick grey eye upon the athletic figure of
Reginald Brandon, who coloured slightly as he encountered at
the same time the glance of Paul Müller.</p>

<p>“It is true,” he said, “I had foolishly separated myself
from the rest of my party; I was intercepted in attempting to
return, and only escaped paying the penalty of my carelessness
by the speed of my horse. The Crow chief was better mounted
than the rest of his tribe, and as soon as I paused to breathe
my horse he attacked, and slightly wounded me; in defending
myself, I killed him.”</p>

<p>“My son,” observed the missionary, “he died as he had
lived, reckless and brave; it rejoices me to hear you speak of
the deed as one of necessity and self&ndash;preservation.”</p>

<p>“I know not,” muttered Pierre, “what he calls necessity;
but it’s a fine feather in the youth’s cap, and our Delawares
shall know it too.”</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features in the character of this
man was the facility with which he acquired the habits and
languages of the different tribes among whom his roving life
had thrown him; moreover, he had the faculty of remembering
with unerring certainty, any face, or spot, or tree, or path,
that he had once seen—so that his services as guide and interpreter
were highly valued; and as Pierre, though a good&ndash;humoured
fellow, was shrewd enough in matters of business,
he usually exacted, and had no difficulty in obtaining a liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
remuneration from the rival leaders of the fur&ndash;trade companies;
he was tolerably well versed in the language of the Crows and
the Black&ndash;feet, the two great nations inhabiting the vast region
between the upper waters of the rivers Platte and Missouri;
and there were few of the roving tribes upon either bank of
the latter among whom he could not make himself understood.
As an interpreter, he dealt fairly by his employer, although he
hated the Black&ndash;feet, in consequence of a warrior of that tribe
having carried off an Indian <i>belle</i> to whom Pierre was paying
his addresses. This offence he had never forgiven, and it gave
him in all subsequent transactions, a natural leaning towards
the Crows, the mortal and hereditary foes of his successful
rival’s tribe.</p>

<p>While Pierre related, in an under tone, to those Delawares
of his party who did not understand English, the victory
obtained over the great war&ndash;chief of the Crows by Reginald
Brandon, the latter kept up a long and interesting conversation
with Ethelston, whom he found already informed by the missionary
of his engagement to Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p>On this subject, Reginald, who knew the prudence of his
friend’s usual character, scarcely expected his sympathy or
concurrence; he was therefore the more agreeably surprised
when he found him disposed to enter into all his plans for the
recovery of his betrothed, with a zeal and enthusiasm almost
equal to his own.</p>

<p>“The good missionary,” said Ethelston, “has told me much
of the early life, as well as of the character and qualities of
Prairie&ndash;bird. I cannot tell you how deeply she has engaged
my interest; my own feelings towards your sister render me
capable of appreciating yours; and I pledge my faith, dear
Reginald, that I will spare neither toil nor exertion, nor life
itself, to aid you in this precious search.”</p>

<p>Reginald grasped his hand,—there was no need of words
of gratitude between them,—and ere long both turned to consult
with Paul Müller, as to their further proceedings. After
due deliberation, they agreed that on the following morning they
should pursue the trail, regardless of their Crow neighbours,
whom they had now little cause to fear, and that previous to
starting they would hold a council, at which Reginald should
propose the distribution of their respective posts, on the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
of march, in the event of their wishing him to retain that of
leader.</p>

<p>The night having passed without any alarm, Reginald summoned
a general council of war before daybreak: as soon as
they were assembled he told them, through Baptiste, who acted
as interpreter, that they were now strong enough to pursue the
trail, without fear of interruption from the Crows; and that if
the latter were foolish enough to make an attack, they would
soon have cause to repent it. He then added that War&ndash;Eagle
their chief being absent on the war&ndash;path, it was necessary for
some one to act as leader until his return; and, as his party had
been joined by so many warriors of experience, he would gladly
place himself under the advice and guidance of the man whom
they might select.</p>

<p>When Baptiste had finished this speech, the oldest warrior
of Ethelston’s party arose and said: “Is it not true that War&ndash;Eagle,
when he went, appointed Netis leader in his place?”
(A murmur of assent came from the lips of Attō and his party.)
“Is it not true,” continued the Indian, “that Netis is a brave
and skilful warrior?—one who need not be silent when the
braves strike the war&ndash;post? His heart is true to the Lenapé,
and he will tell them no lies. If the white men are content
with Netis, the Lenapé wish no other leader. I have
spoken.”</p>

<p>As the scarred and weather&ndash;beaten warrior resumed his seat,
another and a general murmur of approbation broke from the
Delawares; and Ethelston having spoken a few words of similar
import to the white men, Reginald found himself by universal
acclamation chosen leader of the party.</p>

<p>After modestly thanking them for their good opinion, his
first act was to appoint Attō as guide upon the trail, desiring
him to select any two whom he might wish to assist him,
in the event of its becoming forked, or otherwise difficult
to follow; Monsieur Perrot, with the provisions and loaded
mules, occupied the centre of the line of march, in which comparatively
secure post he was accompanied by Paul Müller, the
main body of the hunters and the Delawares being distributed
before and behind the baggage.</p>

<p>For himself Reginald reserved the rear&ndash;guard, where he
retained Ethelston, Baptiste, and a young Delaware, whom he
might despatch upon any emergency to communicate with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
front. He also appointed four of the best mounted of his men,
two on each side of his party, to protect the flanks against any
sudden attack, Pierre being sent forward to render any assistance
to Attō that he might require.</p>

<p>These arrangements being complete, and made known to
the respective parties, they were about to set forth on their
journey, when Attō informed Reginald that the Crow youth
was coming swiftly across the valley towards the encampment,
pursued at a distance by several horsemen of his tribe; the lad
was riding one of the swiftest and most untamed of the wild
horses with which that region abounds, yet he had neither
bridle nor saddle, guiding the animal with a leather thong,
which he had thrown round its nose, and urging it to its
utmost speed with a bow which he held in his right hand. A
few minutes brought the foaming little steed and its rider to the
edge of the thicket, where the latter, still holding the leather
thong, stood in silence before Reginald; his eyes were literally
sparkling with indignant rage, and he did not even deign to
look behind him to see whether his pursuers approached: the
latter, however, did not choose to venture near the encampment;
but as soon as they saw that he had gained its shelter,
they gave a few loud and discordant yells, and disappeared
behind the hill.</p>

<p>The services of Pierre were now put into requisition; and
as soon as the youth found an ear that could understand his
tale, he told it with a rapidity and vehemence that showed the
strong excitement of his feelings: the story, as interpreted by
Pierre, was briefly thus:—</p>

<p>The youth was present on the preceding day at a war&ndash;council,
where the Crows proposed a plan for inveigling the
white men to a feast, and then attacking them unawares, at the
same time desiring him to use the favour that he had found in
their eyes as an additional means for entrapping them: this he
positively refused to do, and boldly told the assembled chiefs
that their counsels were wicked and treacherous, and that he
would in no wise aid or abet them. Indignant at this remonstrance
from a stripling, the partisan had ordered him to be
whipped severely with thongs, and to be tied hand and foot;
the sentence was executed with the utmost cruelty; but he had
contrived early in the morning to slip off his bands, and springing
to his feet, he seized the fleetest horse belonging to the partisan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
and, leaping on its back, galloped off to warn his protector
against the meditated treachery.</p>

<p>The truth of the tale required no confirmation, for the glow
of resentment burnt too fiercely in his eye to be dissembled, and
the light covering of antelope skin which he had thrown across
his shoulders, was saturated with his blood. Reginald’s first
natural impulse was to punish the perpetrators of this outrage,
but he checked it when he remembered the magnitude of the
stake that bound him to the trail, “Tell him, Pierre,” said
he, “that I thank him for his single tongue, and I love him
for his honest brave heart. Ask him if there is anything that
I can do for him.”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied the youth to this question: “tell him
that I have warned him against the forked tongues of my tribe,
because he gave me my life, and was good to me, but I
must not forget that his hand is red with my father’s blood.
The day is very cloudy; the Great Spirit has given a hard
task to the son of the fallen chief; his back is marked like the
back of a slave; he has lived enough.”</p>

<p>The voice of the youth faltered as he pronounced the last
words; the thong dropped from his feeble grasp, and as he fell
to the ground, the wild horse broke away and galloped across
the valley. “He is dying,” said Reginald, bending over him;
“see, here below his hunting shirt is the broken shaft of an
arrow, which one of his pursuers has shot with too true an
aim.” While he spoke the young Crow breathed his last.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">SHOWING HOW WINGENUND FARED IN THE OSAGE CAMP, AND THE
ISSUE OF THE DILEMMA IN WHICH PRAIRIE&ndash;BIRD WAS PLACED BY
MAHÉGA.</p>

<p class="pn">We trust that the compassionate reader is now desirous to
learn something more of the fate of Prairie&ndash;bird and her unfortunate
brother Wingenund, whom we left a prisoner in the
hands of the merciless chief of the Osages. For a long time
after the latter had left her tent, his parting threat rung in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
ears, that she must on the morrow give her consent to be his
bride, or by her refusal consign Wingenund to a cruel and
lingering death. Her busy imagination pourtrayed in vivid
colours the scene of torture, and the heroic fortitude with
which she knew he would endure it, and as she turned from
that picture, the figure of Reginald Brandon rose to her view,
as if upbraiding her with the violation of her plighted troth;
torn by these contending struggles, the poor girl sobbed convulsively,
and the tears forced their way through the fingers
with which she in vain endeavoured, either to suppress or conceal
them. Lita threw her arms round her mistress’s neck,
and strove by her affectionate, yet simple, endearments to soothe
her grief: for a long time they proved unsuccessful, but when
at last she whispered,—</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit is very good; he is stronger than Mahéga;
let Prairie&ndash;bird speak with him as she often did when the
Black Father was with her—“</p>

<p>“True, Lita,” she replied, looking gratefully at the Comanche
girl through her tears; “you remind me of what I
ought not to have forgotten.”</p>

<p>The next moment, saw her prostrate upon her couch—the
book of comfort in her hand, and her earnest prayers ascending
toward Heaven.</p>

<p>She rose from her devotions with a calmed and strengthened
spirit; the first result of which was a desire to converse with
Wingenund, and to decide with him upon the morrow’s fearful
alternative.</p>

<p>Mahéga willingly consented to the interview, justly believing
that it would rather forward than retard his plan for
compelling her consent, compared with which the boy’s life
weighed not a feather in the balance, so he ordered him to be
conveyed to her tent; and the guards who conducted him having
informed her that if she unbound his hands, he would be
instantly seized and removed, they retired to the aperture,
awaiting the termination of the meeting with their habitual
listless indifference.</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird cared not whether they listened, as she spoke
to her young brother in English, of which she knew that they
understood little or nothing.</p>

<p>“Dear Wingenund,” she said, “you heard the threat
uttered by that savage, after he struck you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Is there no device or means by which we can contrive
your escape? we may trust the Comanche girl.”</p>

<p>“I do not see any,” replied the boy calmly; “the eyes of
the Osage chief are open, the hands of his warriors are many
and ready. It does not matter; War&ndash;Eagle and Netis will be
here soon; then all will go well.”</p>

<p>“All well!” said Prairie&ndash;bird, shuddering. “Know you
not, that to&ndash;morrow I must consent to be the wife of the
Osage, or be the cause, and the witness of my brother’s horrible
death?”</p>

<p>Wingenund looked at her with unfeigned surprise.</p>

<p>“The daughter of Tamenund—the Prairie&ndash;bird sent by
the Great Spirit, from an unknown land, to dwell among the
lodges of the Lenapé—she who has learnt all the wise words
of the Black Father—she to become the wife of that wandering
wolf! Can my sister’s heart beat towards him?”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows how I loathe and dread him! worse than
the most poisonous snake in the prairie.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” he replied. “And how ought a wife to
feel towards the man whom she marries?”</p>

<p>“To feel that he is the joy, the food, the treasure of her
heart; the object of her secret thoughts by day, of her dreams
by night; that when she prays to Heaven, his name is on her
lips; that she loves him as—as—“</p>

<p>“As Prairie&ndash;bird loves Netis,” said Wingenund, smiling.</p>

<p>The conscious girl blushed at the impassioned eagerness into
which her feelings had betrayed her, but she did not attempt
to deny her brother’s conclusion, and he continued more
gravely: “Then my sister could not be the wife of the Osage,
without leading a life of misery and falsehood. No, no,” he
added, his bright eye kindled as he spoke; “let to&ndash;morrow
come; Wingenund is ready; he will show that wolf how the
Lenapé die. Let to&ndash;morrow come, and Mahéga shall learn
that Wingenund despises his hate as much as Prairie&ndash;bird scorns
his love. My sister, I have spoken it. The deeds of my
fathers are before my eyes; the blood of the ancient people is
in my veins; words cannot change my mind. Farewell! and
when you see War&ndash;Eagle and Netis, tell them that the Washashe
fire drew neither complaint nor cry from the lips of
Wingenund.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke, his agonised sister looked up in his face, and
read but too plainly the high, unconquerable determination
legibly stamped upon its proud expressive features. She saw
that the instinctive feelings of his race had triumphed over all
the gentler impressions which she and the missionary had endeavoured
to implant, and, knowing that now she might as well
attempt to bend a stubborn oak as to effect any change in his
resolution, she embraced him in silence, and suffered the Osage
guards to lead him from the tent.</p>

<p>Composing herself by a strong effort of self&ndash;command,
Prairie&ndash;bird revolved in her mind various schemes for saving
the life of her devoted brother; one after another she considered
and rejected, until at length the idea occurred to her
that perhaps she might contrive to work upon the superstitious
fears of Mahéga. With this view she examined carefully all
her slender stock of instruments and curiosities,—the novelty
of the burning&ndash;glass was past, the ticking of the watch given
to her by Paul Müller, though it might surprise the Osage,
could not be expected to alarm, or induce him to abandon his
determination. Then she cast her despairing eyes upon the
few volumes which formed her travelling library; among these
her attention was accidentally directed to the almanack which
the good Father had brought to her, from the settlements, when
he gave her the watch, and she sighed when she thought how
often she had amused herself in the spring comparing them
together, calculating the lapse of time, and the changes of season
which they severally announced. Her observation of the
sabbaths had been most punctual, nor had it been interrupted by
the toils and privations of the journey, so she had no difficulty
in finding the week or the day then passing. “July,” she
exclaimed, reading to herself half aloud, “only two weeks of
this sad month are yet past, methinks they seem more like
fourteen months than fourteen days! See here, too, on the
opposite leaf prophecies regarding wind and weather. How
often would the dear Father point these out to me, and strive
to explain the wonderful terms in which they describe the
movements of the stars; he was very patient, but they were
too hard for me; I am sure he tried to make me understand
these strange words, ‘Aphelion,’ ‘Apogee,’ ‘Perigee,’ but if
he ever succeeded, I have forgotten it all. What is this notice
in larger letters? to&ndash;morrow, to&ndash;morrow it stands written,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
‘Total eclipse of the sun, visible at Philadelphia, 9h. 42m.’—surely
surely it will be visible here too. I will trust to it, I
will build my faith upon it, and Wingenund’s life shall yet be
saved.” So saying, she clasped her hands together, and her
lovely countenance beamed with re&ndash;awakened hope.</p>

<p>Lita, who had been watching her mistress with affectionate
solicitude, and listening with childish wonder to her half&ndash;uttered
soliloquy, was overcome with surprise at this sudden
change in her demeanour; she thought that Prairie&ndash;bird had
been conversing with some unseen being; under which impression
she approached, and asked, timidly,</p>

<p>“Has Olitipa seen a Good Spirit, and have her ears drunk
words of comfort?”</p>

<p>“Olitipa has received words of comfort,” replied her mistress,
kindly; “they seem to her words from Heaven; she
trusts that she may not be deceived; she will address her
evening prayer to the Great Merciful Spirit above, and retire
to rest, at least to such rest as it may be His will to give her.”</p>

<p>For many hours after Prairie&ndash;bird had been stretched upon
her furry couch did her thoughts dwell upon the solar eclipse now
the foundation of her hopes; she remembered how the missionary
had explained to her that it was visible at one hour in one part
of the earth, at a different hour in another part; then she wondered
whether at the spot where she now was it would be seen
sooner or later than at Philadelphia,—this doubt her science
could not resolve, and it held her long in anxious suspense;
but overwearied nature at length claimed her rights, and she
sank into an unrefreshing dreamy slumber, in which the images
of Wingenund, Mahéga, and Reginald Brandon were stalking
confusedly over an eclipsed and darkened region of earth.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning Mahéga, who had resolved
not to lose this favourable opportunity for working upon the
fears of Prairie&ndash;bird, caused a pile of dry branches of wood to
be placed round a tree, which stood nearly opposite to her
tent, to which he ordered Wingenund to be secured with
thongs of bison&ndash;hide; after which he and his warriors seated
themselves in a semicircle before their victim, passing the
pipe deliberately from mouth to mouth, as if to enjoy his suspense
and terror.</p>

<p>If such was their object, it met with little success, for the
young Delaware, in the brightest day of his youth and freedom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
had never worn so proud and lofty an air as that which
now sat enthroned upon his brow.</p>

<p>“A thousand warriors of the Lenapé, whose blood is in my
veins, have gone before me to the happy fields,—they knew
not fear, and I the last of their children will bring no shame
upon their race; when I come they will say, ‘Welcome, Wingenund!’
and before many winters and summers are past,
War&ndash;Eagle and Netis, Prairie&ndash;bird and the Black Father, will
join me, and the blue eyes of the Lily of Mooshanne will be
there also, and we will dwell in a land of streams and flowers,
of numberless deer, and abundant corn, unvexed by cold, or
want, or pain.”</p>

<p>Such was the vision that rose before the mental eye of the
youth, and so completely was he engrossed by it, that he took
not the slightest notice of the group assembled to put him to
a slow and agonising death.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prairie&ndash;bird having prayed earnestly to Heaven
to support her, and pardon the deceit which she was about to
practise, dressed herself with more than usual care, and coming
forth from her tent, stood before Mahéga with a dignity
of demeanour, to the effect of which even his fierce and intractable
nature was not insensible. He rose not, however, at
her approach, but contented himself with inquiring, “Has
Olitipa come to save her brother’s life, or to kill him?”</p>

<p>“Neither,” replied the maiden, firmly; “she is come to
give good counsel to Mahéga; let him beware how he neglects
it!”</p>

<p>“Let not Olitipa’s speech travel in circles,” said the angry
chief. “Mahéga has said that this day she should consent to
be his wife, or she must see that feeble boy burnt before
her eyes,—there are but two paths,—which does Olitipa
choose?”</p>

<p>“The feet of foolish men often wander where there is no
path at all,” replied Prairie&ndash;bird; and she added, with solemnity,
pointing upward to Heaven: “There is only <i>one</i> path,
and one Guide, the Great Spirit who dwells above!”</p>

<p>Those of the Osages who were familiar with the Delaware
tongue in which she was speaking, looked at each other, as if
wondering at her words, but Mahéga, whose passion was only
increased by her exceeding beauty, answered vehemently,</p>

<p>“It is easy for Olitipa to talk and to make children believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
that her words are those of the Great Spirit—Mahéga is not
a child.”</p>

<p>“If he compare his strength with that of the Great Spirit,”
said the maiden, boldly, “Mahéga’s is less than the least finger
of a child. Who can tell the power of the Great Spirit? The
strong wind is his breath,—the thunder is his voice,—the
sun is his smile. If He is angry and withdraws the sun, day
is turned into night—darkness and fear dwell in the hearts
of men.”</p>

<p>The energy of her language and manner were not altogether
without their effect even upon the stern nature of Mahéga;
nevertheless, he replied,</p>

<p>“These are but the notes of singing&ndash;birds. Mahéga waits
for the choice of Olitipa,—she becomes his wife, or the fire
is kindled at the feet of Wingenund.”</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird cast an anxious glance athwart the blue vault
above; not a cloud was in the sky, and the sun shone with the
full brightness of an American July. She would not yet
abandon hope, but, making a strong and successful effort to
maintain her composure, she said in a firm, impressive tone,
“Mahéga, let there be a bargain between us; you seek Olitipa
for a wife; if it be the will of the Great Spirit, she will submit,
and her brother’s life will be spared; but if the Great
Spirit is displeased, and shows his anger by drawing a cloak
over the face of that bright sun in the heavens, Mahéga will
obey His will, and let the brother of Olitipa go away unhurt.—Is
Mahéga content that it shall be so?</p>

<p>“He is,” replied the chief, “if the sign be such as he and
the Osage warriors may look upon with wonder; not a mist,
or dark cloud.”</p>

<p>“It will be such as will make Mahéga <i>tremble</i>,” replied the
maiden with dignity. “Warriors of the Washashe, you have
heard the treaty. Before the sun has reached yon western
peak, the answer of the Great Spirit will be known.” Having
thus spoken, she withdrew into the tent, leaving the Osages
gazing upon each other with undisguised awe and amazement.</p>

<p>The maiden threw herself upon her couch in an agony of
suspense, greater than can be described! It was terrible to
think that her every hope of escaping from the dreadful
alternative, was staked upon a sentence in an almanack, of the
correctness of which she had not the slightest power to judge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Even the well&ndash;intentioned attempts at consolation made by her
affectionate Lita were of no avail; her unhappy mistress entreated
her to remain at the door of the tent, and report whatever
might occur; within and without a profound stillness
reigned. The prisoner stood motionless by the sapling to
which he was bound; Mahéga smoked his pipe in the full
confidence of anticipated triumph, surrounded by his warriors,
who, less sceptical, or more superstitious than their chief,
looked and listened, expecting some confirmation of the last
words of Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p>Although the sun could not be opposite the rock which she
had pointed out for nearly three hours, of which not a fourth
part had yet elapsed, the anxious girl began to imagine that
hope was at an end. Visions of future degradation and misery
shot through her brain; she tore from her hot brow the fillet
that confined her hair, which floated in glossy luxuriance over
her shoulders. The reproaches of Reginald Brandon rung in
her ears. The loathed embrace of Mahéga crept over her
shuddering frame! At this crisis her eye fell upon the handle
of the sharp knife concealed in her bosom; she drew it forth;
the triumph of the powers of Evil seemed at hand, when a
cry of surprise and terror from Lita recalled her wandering
senses. She sprang to the door; visible darkness was spreading
over the scene, and the terrified Osages were looking upward
to the partially obscured disk of the sun, over the centre
of which an opaque circular body was spread; a brilliant ring
being left around its outer ridge.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird gazed upon the wondrous spectacle like one
entranced; the late fearful struggle in her breast had given
a supernatural lustre to her eye; her frame was still under high
nervous excitement, and as, with long hair floating down her
back, she pointed with one hand to the eclipsed sun, and with
the other to Mahéga, well might the savage imagine that he
saw before him a prophetess whose will the Spirit of Fire must
obey. Under the influence of awe and dread, which he strove
in vain to conceal, he moved forward, and said to her, “It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
enough! let Olitipa speak to the Great Spirit that the light
may come again.”</p>

<p>The sound of his voice recalled the mind of Prairie&ndash;bird to
a consciousness of what had passed. She answered not, but
with a gesture of assent motioned to him to withdraw, and
supporting herself against one of the trees that grew in front
of her tent, she knelt beside it, and, veiling her face in the redundant
tresses of her hair, found relief in a flood of tears.
Overwhelmed by a sense of the merciful interposition by which
she and her brother had been saved, and by a feeling of deep
contrition for the sudden impulse of self&ndash;destruction to which,
in a moment of mental agony, she had yielded, she thought
neither of the continuance nor the withdrawing of the dark
phenomenon of external nature, but of the evil gloom which
had for the time eclipsed the light of grace in her heart, and
the tears which bedewed her cheek were tears of mingled penitence
and gratitude.</p>

<p>Still, Nature held on her appointed course; after a few
minutes the moon passed onward in her path, and the rays of
the sun, no longer intercepted, again shed their brightness over
earth and sky.</p>

<p>The Osages, attributing these effects to the communing of
Prairie&ndash;bird with the Great Spirit, stood in silent awe as she
arose to retire to her tent, and her secret humiliation became,
in their eyes, her triumph.</p>

<p>Mahéga, finding that he had no pretext for refusing to release
Wingenund, and that his warriors evidently expected him
to fulfil his promise, ordered the youth to be unbound; and in
the height of his generosity, desired that some food might be
offered to him, which Wingenund scornfully rejected.</p>

<p>The Osage chief having called aside two of those most devoted
to him, spoke to them a few words apart; and then,
addressing his liberated prisoner in the Delaware tongue, he
said, “The Osage warriors will conduct Wingenund two hours
on his journey: he will then be free to go where he likes; but
if he is again found skulking round the Osage camp, nothing
shall save his life.”</p>

<p>Wingenund knew that he was to be turned loose in a desolate
region, unarmed and half&ndash;starved, but his proud spirit
would not permit him to ask the slightest boon of his enemy;
and without a word of reply, without even directing a look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
towards his sister’s tent, he turned and followed his conductors.</p>

<p>For several miles they pursued the back&ndash;foot<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> of the trail
by which they had come from the eastward, Wingenund being
placed in the centre without weapon of any kind, and the two
Osages marching one before, and the other behind him, being
well armed with bow, knife, and tomahawk. The youth, unconscious
that they had secret instructions from Mahéga to
kill him as soon as they reached a convenient and sufficiently
distant spot, made no attempt to escape, but walked quietly
between them, considering within himself whether he should
endeavour to rejoin his party, or persevere in hovering in the
neighbourhood of the Osages: if a suspicion of Mahéga’s
treachery did cross his mind, he allowed it not to influence his
bearing, for he moved steadily forward, not even turning his
head to watch the Osage behind him.</p>

<p>About five or six miles from Mahéga’s camp, the trail passed
along the edge of a low wood, which skirted the banks of the
same stream that flowed through the upper valley. This was
the place where they proposed to kill their prisoner, and hide
his body in the bushes, the chief having commanded that the
murder should be kept secret from the rest of his party.
They had just passed a thicket on the side of the trail, when
the terrible battle&ndash;cry of War&ndash;Eagle rose behind them, and his
tomahawk clove the skull of the Osage in the rear. Quick as
thought, Wingenund sprang upon the one in front, and pinioned
his arms; the Osage tried in vain to disengage them from
the grasp of his light and active opponent. Brief was the
struggle, for the deadly weapon of the Delaware chief descended
again, and the second Osage lay a corpse upon the
trail.</p>

<p>The brothers, having exchanged an affectionate but hasty
greeting, took the spoils from their enemies according to
Indian fashion, War&ndash;Eagle contenting himself with their
scalps, and his brother taking such weapons and articles of
dress as his present condition rendered necessary for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
comfort and defence; after which, they threw the two
bodies into the thicket, into which the Osages had intended
to cast that of Wingenund, and continued their course at a
rapid rate towards the eastward, War&ndash;Eagle relating as they
went the events which had brought him so opportunely to the
scene of action: they were briefly as follow:—</p>

<p>When he left his party, he never halted nor slackened his
speed until he saw the smoke of the Osage camp&ndash;fire: concealing
himself in the adjoining wood, he had witnessed all the
surprising occurrences of the day; and in the event of the
Osages actually proceeding to set fire to the faggots around
Wingenund, he was prepared to rush upon them alone, and
either rescue his brother or perish with him: but, with the
self&ndash;command and foresight of an Indian, he kept this desperate
and almost hopeless attempt for the last chance; and
when to his surprise and joy he saw the prisoner sent upon the
trail with a guard of only two Osages, he took advantage of a
bank of rising ground, behind which he crept, and moving
swiftly forward under its shelter, gained unperceived the
thicket, where he had so successfully waylaid them.</p>

<p>Fearing a pursuit, the brothers never abated their speed
throughout the evening, or the early portion of the night. A
few hours before dawn, some scattered bushes near the path
offering them a precarious shelter, they lay down to snatch a
short repose; a mouthful of dried bison&ndash;meat, which remained
in War&ndash;Eagle’s belt, he gave to his exhausted brother; and one
blanket covering them both, they slept soundly and undisturbed
until the sun was high in heaven.</p>

they had faithfully executed the treacherous commission with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
which he had entrusted them. When he found that the evening
passed away, and that the successive hours of the night
brought no intelligence of them, he became alarmed lest they
should have fallen in with some hostile band of Indians; an
occurrence which, in addition to the loss of two of his warriors,
would threaten imminent danger to his whole party.</p>

<p>At the earliest peep of dawn he set out in search of them,
accompanied by three of his followers, giving orders to the
remainder to observe a strict watch during his absence. Traversing
the little valley in front of his camp with hasty strides,
he struck into the eastward trail, and followed it with unabated
speed until he reached the spot where the deadly struggle
of the preceding evening had arisen. Here the indications
were too evident to leave a moment’s doubt upon his mind;
the grass on and beside the trail was stained with blood, and
from the neighbouring thicket were heard the snarls and yells
of a pack of wolves quarrelling over their horrible banquet;
while high in air several buzzards were wheeling round and
round, as if endeavouring to find courage to descend and dispute
the prey with the quadruped spoilers.</p>

<p>Dashing into the thicket, and driving the snarling wolves
before him, Mahéga found his worst fears realised, and his
horror&ndash;struck warriors stood in silence beside the mangled
remains of their comrades. The conduct of Indians under
such circumstances is uncertain and various as their mood,
their impulse, their tribe, and their age. Sometimes they
indulge in fearful threats of vengeance; sometimes in the
most woeful howlings and lamentations; at others they observe
a silence as still as the death which they are contemplating.</p>

<p>The Osages, on this occasion, following the example of their
leader, spoke not a word, although the sight before them (far
too horrible for description) was sufficient to try the strongest
nerves; it was chiefly by the immoveable firmness of his
character that Mahéga had gained and maintained the despotic
influence which he exercised over his followers; neither did
it fail him on this occasion, for he proceeded to examine the
mutilated remains of his deceased warriors with his usual
coolness and sagacity, in order that he might discover by whom
the deed had been perpetrated; on a close inspection of the
skulls, he found that both had been fractured by a tomahawk
blow, which had fallen in a direction almost vertical, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
rather at a posterior angle of inclination, whence he immediately
inferred that they had been killed by some enemy who
had surprised and attacked them from behind, and not in an
open fight: after a long and careful observation of the fractures,
he was of opinion that they were made by the same
weapon. This inference, however, he kept to himself; and
directing two of his followers to pay such offices to the dead
as were possible under the circumstances, and then to return
to the camp, he went forward with the remaining Osage, to
satisfy himself as to the manner in which the calamity had
occurred: he remembered to have seen Wingenund starting
on the trail, and, although he knew him to be bold and active,
he could not for an instant entertain the belief that a stripling,
wearied with a sleepless night, stiff from being so many hours
bound with thongs, and totally unprovided with arms, could
have killed his two guards, who were strong, wary, and well&ndash;armed
men!</p>

<p>For some distance Mahéga continued his course in moody
silence, the beaten trail affording no indication sufficient to
guide him in his conjecture, but at length he reached a place
where it crossed a small rivulet, the flat banks of which were
sprinkled with a kind of gravelly sand: here he paused and
examined every inch of the ground with the eye of a lynx;
nor was it long before he detected the foot&ndash;prints which he
sought, a smaller and a greater, the latter showing longer
intervals, and a deeper impression.</p>

<p>Rising from his stooping scrutiny, the eyes of the chief glared
with fury, as he turned to his follower, and, in a voice almost
inarticulate with rage, groaned the hated name of War&ndash;Eagle.</p>

<p>“It is,” he continued vehemently, “plain as the moon in
the sky, the trail of the cursed Lenapé and the light foot of
his brother; see here, War&ndash;Eagle has walked through the
water, and Wingenund has sprung over it; the dew has fallen
since they passed, they are far before us; but Mahéga must
not sleep till their scalps are in his belt. Is Toweno ready?”
inquired the fierce chief, tightening his girdle while he loosened
the tomahawk suspended from it.</p>

<p>“Toweno is ready,” replied the Indian, “to fight or run by
the side of Mahéga from morning until night; his hand is not
weak, nor are his feet slow, but the great chief must not let
the angry spirit bring a cloud before his eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let Toweno speak,” said Mahéga, controlling his fierce
impatience, “his words will find a path to open ears.”</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle,” pursued the Osage, “is swift of foot and
cunning as a twice&ndash;trapped wolf. He has not come upon this
far war&ndash;path alone. Wingenund has been prowling round
the camp; and while Mahéga follows the trail of War&ndash;Eagle,
the youth may guide the pale&ndash;faced warrior called Netis, with
his band, to the encampment of the Washashe. Toweno has
need of no more words.”</p>

<p>Mahéga saw in a moment the truth and force of his follower’s
suggestion, and smothering for the moment his passion
for revenge, he resolved to return at once to his encampment.</p>

<p>“The counsel of Toweno is good,” said he; “when a
friend speaks, Mahéga is not deaf.”</p>

<p>Among the features that distinguish the character of the
North American Indian, there is none more remarkable, none
more worthy of the study and the imitation of civilised man,
than the patience and impartial candour with which they listen
to the advice or opinion of others: although so prone to be
swayed by passion and governed by impulse, the Indian seems
to have a wonderful power of laying aside these predispositions,
when discussing a matter privately with a friend, or openly in
council. The decorum with which all their public discussions
are conducted has been observed and recorded by every writer
familiar with their habits, from the time of Charlevoix, and of
the interesting “Letters Edifiantes” to the present day.
Colden, Tanner, Mackenzie, and many others who have described
the Northern tribes, concur in bearing their testimony
to the truth of this observation; Heckewalder, Loskiel, Smith,
Jefferson, confirm it in the central region; and the Spanish
writers bear frequent witness to it in their descriptions of the
Southern tribes whom they met with in their campaigns in
Florida and the adjacent country. In reading the account
given of the numerous tribes inhabiting the vast region between
the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains, by Clarke,
Lewis, Long, and others, the same observation forces itself
upon us almost at every page, and it is the more remarkable
when we reflect upon two facts: first, that we find this
characteristic attributed to forty or fifty different nations
inhabiting a continent larger than Europe, by the concurring
testimony of travellers from different countries, and holding
the most opposite opinions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, we do not find a similar characteristic distinguishing
other savages, or nomadic tribes in Asia, Africa, or the
Pacific Islands.</p>

<p>There is not a public body in Europe, from the British
parliament down to the smallest burgh meeting, that might not
study with advantage the proceedings of an Indian council,
whether as described in the faithful pages of the German
missionaries, or, as it may still be seen by any one who has
leisure and inclination to visit those remote regions, where the
Indian character is least changed and contaminated by intercourse
with the whites. Such an observer would find his
attention attracted to two remarkable facts; first, that no
speaker is ever interrupted; and, secondly, that only those
speak who from age, rank, and deeds, are entitled to be
listened to.</p>

<p>It is a popular and plausible reply to say, that discussions
concerning the complicated business of a great country cannot
be carried on like the unimportant “talks” of these savage
tribes. This reasoning is shallow and full of sophistry; for
many of the Indian councils above referred to have involved
all the dearest interests of the nation; their soil, their pride,
their ancestral traditions, all were at stake, perhaps all with
little more than a nominal alternative, to be bartered for the
grasping white man’s beads, whiskey, and subsidies. In
these councils, every listening Indian must have felt that his
own home, the lodge built by his father, and the patch of
maize cultivated by his family, were dependent on the issue of
the negotiation, and yet it is not upon record that a chief or
elder brave was ever interrupted in his speech, or that the
decorum of the council was infringed by irregularity or tumult
on the part of those who might have considered themselves
injured and aggrieved.</p>

<p>Even in regard to time, it is a great mistake to suppose that
anything is gained by interruption; for an obstinate talker
will carry his point in the end; and although the persevering
exclamations and groanings, and crowings of an impatient
House of Commons may succeed in drowning his voice, and
forcing him to sit down, he will rise again on some other
occasion, and inflict upon his hearers a speech whose bulk and
bitterness are both increased by the suppressed fermentation
which it has undergone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving the moody and dispirited Osage chief to find his
way back to his encampment, we will now return to Reginald
Brandon and his party, whom we left starting westward on
the trail, marching in regular order, and prepared, without
delaying the progress, to repel any hostile attempt on the
part of the Crows. The latter band seemed, however, so
impressed with the strength, discipline, and appointments of
the white men’s force, now that it had received a strong
reinforcement, that they gave up all present intention of
molesting it, and went off in an opposite direction in search
of game, horses, or booty where these might be acquired with
less risk and danger.</p>

<p>Reginald and Ethelston went together on the line of
march; and although the spirits of the former were damped
by the recent and melancholy fate of the Crow youth, in
whom he had felt much interest, the buoyant hilarity of his
disposition did not long resist his friend’s endeavours to
banish that subject from his thoughts, and to turn the conversation
to topics more immediately connected with the object
of their present expedition.</p>

<p>Reginald having once confided to Ethelston his love for
Prairie&ndash;bird, found a pleasure in describing to him her beauty,
her natural grace, her simplicity,—in short, all those charms
and attractions which had carried by storm the fortress of his
heart; and it seemed that his friend was no less willing to
listen than he to talk upon the subject; repeating question
after question, regarding her with an unwearied intensity of
curiosity that excited at length the surprise of Reginald
himself.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Edward,” he said, laughing, “did I not know
that you are devoted to a certain lady on the banks of the
Muskingum, and that your attachments are reasonably steady,
I could almost believe that the fidelity and eloquence with
which I have described Prairie&ndash;bird had made you fall in love
with her yourself.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are claiming more merit for your own
eloquence than is due to it,” said Ethelston, in a similar tone,
“you forget that before I joined you, Paul Müller and I had
travelled many hundred miles together; and it is a topic upon
which he speaks as warmly and partially as yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well he may!” replied Reginald with energy, “for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
owes everything to his affectionate care and instruction, in
return for which she loves and venerates him as if he were her
father.”</p>

<p>In such conversation did the friends while away many
weary hours on the march; and at the midday halt and
evening camp, they were joined by the worthy missionary,
who, justly proud of his pupil, and knowing that he was
addressing those who would not soon be weary of hearing her
praises, told them many anecdotes of her early youth, with an
earnestness and feeling which often caused Reginald to avert
his face, and Ethelston to shade his brow thoughtfully with
his hand.</p>

<p>Nor was the march unenlivened by scenes of a merrier
kind, for Pierre, Baptiste, and Monsieur Perrot kept up a
constant round of fun and raillery around their camp&ndash;kettle;
the latter continuing to act as chief cook for all the white men
and half&ndash;bred in the party, and leaving the Delawares to dress
their food after their own fancy. Provisions were abundant in
the camp, and Perrot contrived by his ingenuity to give a
variety both in appearance and flavour to supplies, which in
truth consisted of little more than parched maize, biscuit,
coffee, and bison&ndash;meat. He talked incessantly, and his lively
sallies not only amused his two companions, but often drew a
smile from Reginald, in spite of the anxiety occasioned by the
object of the expedition.</p>

<p>“Master Baptiste,” said the valet cook (as nearly as his
language may be rendered into English), “methinks those
great hands of yours are better skilled in chopping Sioux
skulls, or felling bee&ndash;trees, than in the science of butchery;
see here, what unchristian lumps of meat you have brought
me to dress!”</p>

<p>“Were it not for these great hands, as you call them,”
replied the sturdy guide, “you, Master Perrot, with those fine&ndash;skinned
fingers, would often ere this have seen little of either
deer or bison&ndash;meat for your supper.”</p>

<p>“As for that, I deny not that you are tolerably successful
in hunting, and your load of venison is sometimes brought
decently home; but in the cutting up of a bison, your education
has been much neglected.”</p>

<p>“It may be so, Monsieur Perrot,” answered Baptiste: “I
do not pretend to much skill in the matter, and yet methinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
I should understand as much of it as one who had never seen
a bison a month since; and who could not now dress a cow’s
udder half so well as an Osage squaw.” Pierre laughed outright
at his comrade’s depreciation of Perrot’s culinary skill;
and the latter, whose temper was not a whit ruffled by this
disparagement of his talents, inquired with the utmost gravity,</p>

<p>“Pray, Baptiste, instruct me in this matter, for I doubt
not, although you have so grievously mutilated the ox, that
your method of dressing the cow’s udder must be worth
learning.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” replied Baptiste, “I will show you that when we
come among cows and squaws; meanwhile I recommend you
to make yourself a spare peruke, as we may soon be running
foul of those Osages, or some other roving Indians, who may
chance to carry off that moveable scalp on the top of your
head.”</p>

<p>This allusion to Perrot’s disaster and narrow escape among
the Sioux, turned the laugh against him; but he quickly
checked its current by placing before his companions some
buffalo steaks, and cakes of maize flour, which practically
contradicted all that they had been saying in his disparagement
of the good&ndash;humoured Frenchman’s cookery.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the second day’s march, one of the
Delawares, who had been sent forward to reconnoitre, galloped
to the rear and reported that he had seen one or two men at a
great distance a&ndash;head, nearly in the line of the trail which they
were now following. Reginald immediately sprung upon
Nekimi, who was walking like a pet&ndash;dog at his side; and,
accompanied by Ethelston, rode forward to examine the
strangers with his telescope. The undulations of the intervening
ground hid them for a considerable time from his view,
and when they reappeared they were near enough to be clearly
distinguished through his glass.</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle,” he exclaimed, “Heaven be praised! It is
my brave Indian brother returning with young Wingenund.
Edward, I will now present to you the noblest creature that
ever yet I encountered in human shape. My feelings would
prompt me to rush forward and embrace him; but we must
conform ourselves to Indian usage here, or we shall lose the
good opinion of our Delaware friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Reginald had confided to his friend all that had passed
between himself and War&ndash;Eagle, not even omitting his unfortunate
and long&ndash;cherished passion for Prairie&ndash;bird, so that
Ethelston awaited his approach with no ordinary interest.</p>

<p>As the Delaware chieftain advanced with erect front, his
expanded chest thrown slightly forward, and the fine symmetry
of his form developed in every movement as he stepped lightly
over the prairie, Ethelston felt that he had never seen, either
in nature or in the works of art, a finer specimen of manhood;
and when he witnessed the grave simplicity which mingled
with his cordial greeting of Reginald Brandon, he could not
deny that features, form, and bearing stamped the Delaware
chieftain at once as one of the lords of the creation. Neither
did the gentle gracefulness of the slighter figure by whom he
was accompanied escape Ethelston’s notice, and he felt no
difficulty in recognising, in the interesting features of the
youth, that Wingenund of whose high and amiable qualities
he had heard so much from Reginald.</p>

<p>“These are, indeed,” said Ethelston to himself, “worthy
descendants of the Lenapé princes, whose sway in bygone days
extended over many hundred leagues of fertile territory, from
the Ohio to the Atlantic coast: whose broad lands are now tilled
by the Saxon plough, on the site of whose ancient villages
now stand the churches and the popular streets of Baltimore,
and the city of Brotherly Love. With the loss of their dominion,
most of these once&ndash;powerful tribes have lost the highest
and best characteristics of their race; subdued by the rifle,
corrupted by the silver, degraded by the ardent spirits of the
white man, they present but too often a spectacle in which it
is difficult to recognise any traces of the attributes with which
the narratives of our early travellers and missionaries invest
them. But these are, indeed, features which a Titian would
not have scorned to delineate; these are forms which the pencil
of Michael Angelo and the chisel of Praxiteles would have
rejoiced to immortalise.”</p>

<p>While these thoughts were rapidly passing through the mind
of Ethelston, the greeting between Reginald and War&ndash;Eagle
was exchanged; and the former had given to his Indian brother
a hasty sketch of the events which had occurred in his absence
and of those which had led to the reinforcement brought by
Ethelston. A gleam of joy shot athwart the features of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Delaware, as he learnt the vengeance which his warriors had
taken of their enemies; and his quick eye glanced with gratified
pride over the scalps which they displayed, and the magnificent
bear&ndash;claw collar dependent from Attō’s neck. The Lenapé
braves saw too that the tomahawk of their leader had not slept
in its belt on his solitary war&ndash;path, for the scalps of the two
unfortunate Osages whom he had slain hung close to its handle;
and though there was no shout of triumph, an audible murmur
of satisfaction ran through the whole band.</p>

<p>When Reginald presented Ethelston to War&ndash;Eagle as his
earliest and most faithful friend from childhood, the chief,
taking him by the hand, said, “The friend of Netis is the
friend of War&ndash;Eagle,—their hearts are one; he is very welcome.”
Reginald then presented Wingenund to his friend,
as the gallant youth who had saved his life on the banks of
the Muskingum.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I had long known him,” said Ethelston, shaking
his hand cordially; “I have come lately from Mooshanne,
where his name is not forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Is the Lily of Mooshanne well?” inquired the youth,
fixing his dark and earnest eyes full upon the countenance of
the person whom he was addressing. Ethelston had been
prepared by his friend’s description of Wingenund for a
demeanour and character highly interesting; but there was a
melody, a pathos, a slight tremor in the tone in which he
spoke those few words, there was also in his countenance a
touching expression of melancholy, that thrilled to the heart
of Ethelston. How quick is the jealous eye of love! Ethelston
knew that Wingenund had passed only one day in the
society of Lucy, yet he saw in an instant the deep impression
which that day had left on the young Indian’s mind.</p>

<p>“The Lily of Mooshanne is well,” he replied. “If she
had known that I should visit her brother, and his Lenapé
friends, she would have bid me speak many kind words to
them from her.”</p>

<p>Wingenund passed on, and War&ndash;Eagle related to the two
friends the leading circumstances of his own expedition,
omitting all mention of the fatigue, the hunger, the sleepless
nights that he had undergone, before he discovered and reached
the Osage camp.</p>

<p>As he described the scene of Wingenund being tied to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
post, with the dried faggots at his feet, and the appearance of
Prairie&ndash;bird when Mahéga called upon her to pronounce her
own or her brother’s fate, both of his auditors held their
breath with anxious suspense, which gave place to astonishment,
as he proceeded to relate with undisguised awe the
mystery of the solar eclipse, which led to the liberation of
Wingenund.</p>

<p>When he had concluded his narrative, Reginald was speechless;
and Ethelston, catching the Delaware’s arm, inquired in
a low whisper, “Has the Osage dared, or will he dare, to
make Prairie&ndash;bird his wife by force?”</p>

<p>“He has not,” replied the chief; “the words of Olitipa,
and the black sun, made him afraid.” He added, drawing
himself proudly to his full height, “Had the wolf threatened
to touch her with his paw, the tomahawk of War&ndash;Eagle would
have pierced his heart, or the bones of the Lenapé chief and
his brother would have been picked by the buzzards of the
mountains.” So saying, War&ndash;Eagle joined his expectant
warriors.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mahéga returned to his camp, in a vexed
and gloomy state of mind; as he passed the tent of Prairie&ndash;bird,
a darker frown lowered upon his brow; and having
entered his lodge, he seated himself, without speaking to any
of those who had assembled there in expectation of his return.</p>

<p>The youngest of the Osages present having handed him a
lighted pipe, retired to a corner of the lodge, where he
resumed his occupation of sharpening the head of a barbed
arrow, leaving the chief to his own meditations. These
dwelt mainly upon Prairie&ndash;bird, and were of a nature so
mingled and vague, as to cause him the greatest perplexity.
The effect of her beauty and attractions upon his passions had
rather increased than diminished: he loved her as much as
one so fierce and selfish could love another; yet, on the other
hand, he felt that he ought to hate her, as being the sister of
War&ndash;Eagle, and the betrothed of the man who had struck and
disgraced him: with these contending feelings there was
blended a superstitious awe of her communion with the world
of spirits, and a remote hope that some of these supernatural
agencies might turn her heart in his favour, and induce her
not only to become his bride, but zealously to employ all her
mysterious powers in the furtherance of his ambitious schemes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the train of thought pursued by the Osage, as he
leaned against the pile of furs that supported his back, and
stretching his huge limbs at their ease, watched the eddying
wreaths of fragrant smoke, which gently puffed from his
mouth and <i>nostril</i>, wound their slow way to the fissures in
the lodge&ndash;roof by which they escaped.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The suggestion of Toweno had made a strong impression
upon Mahéga’s mind, and led him to expect, at no distant
period, an attack on the part of the Delawares; and as he was
uncertain of the force which his enemy might bring against
him, he resolved to make a timely retreat to some spot where
a pursuit, if attempted by the Delawares, might enable him to
take them at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>Calling to him an Osage who was leaning against one of the
outer posts that supported the lodge, he desired him to make,
with a comrade, a careful search of the neighbourhood, and to
report any trail or suspicious appearance that they might find;
and when he had given these orders he summoned Toweno,
and started with him towards the head of the little valley,
without informing him of the object which he had in view;
but as the latter was the only person to whom the chief had
entrusted the secret of the câche, where his most valuable
spoils were deposited, and as they were now marching in that
direction, he was not at a loss to divine Mahéga’s intentions.
After a brief silence, the chief said to his follower, “Do the
thoughts of Toweno walk upon the same path with the
thoughts of Mahéga?”</p>

<p>“They do,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Can Toweno speak them?”</p>

<p>“Mahéga intends to leave the camp before the Lenapé
come; and taking some goods with him as presents to the
mountain tribes, to find a safe place where the enemy cannot
follow him.”</p>

<p>“Toweno says well,” answered the chief, with a grim smile,
“but that is not enough, the Lenapé must be made a fool, he
must be put upon a wrong trail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is good, if it can be done,” said Toweno, gravely,
“but it is not easy to put sand in the eyes of War&ndash;Eagle.”</p>

<p>“Mahéga will put sand into his eyes, and a knife into his
heart before this moon becomes a circle,” replied the chief,
clutching as he went the haft of his scalp&ndash;knife, and unconsciously
lengthening his stride under the excitement produced
by the thoughts of a conflict with his hated foe. They had
now reached the “câche,” which was a large dry hole in the
side of a rocky bank, the entrance to which was closed by a
stone, and admirably concealed by a dense thicket of brambles
and wild raspberry bushes: having rolled away the stone,
Mahéga withdrew from the câche a plentiful supply of beads,
vermillion, powder, and cloths of various colour, being part
of the plunder taken from the camp of the unfortunate Delawares,
and wrapping in two blankets as much as he and his
companion could carry, they replaced the stone, carefully concealing
their foot&ndash;prints as they retreated, by strewing them
with leaves and grass. At a spot very near the câche was the
skeleton of a deer, which Mahéga had killed on a former occasion,
and purposely dragged thither. As soon as they reached
this point, they took no further precaution to conceal their
trail, because, even if it were found, the party discovering it
would stop under the impression that it was made by the
hunters who had killed the deer. On returning to the camp
they met the two Osages who had been despatched to reconnoitre,
and who reported that they had found one fresh Indian
trail in the woods opposite the little valley, and that they had
followed it as far as the stream, where, from its direction and
appearance, they were assured it was the trail of War&ndash;Eagle;
and Mahéga now first learnt that his daring foe had been
within eighty yards of the spot selected for the torture of
Wingenund. His was not a nature to give way to idle
regrets; equally a stranger to fear and to remorse, the future
troubled him but little, the past not at all, excepting when it
afforded him food wherewith to cherish his revenge; so the
information now received did not interrupt him in carrying
into execution his plans for retreat. Accordingly, he desired
Toweno to summon his warriors to a council, and in a
short time the band, now reduced to eight besides himself,
assembled in front of his lodge. Here he harangued them
with his usual cunning sagacity, pointing out to them the risk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
of remaining in their present position, and setting before them
in the most favourable light the advantages which might
accrue from their falling in with some of the peaceable tribes
among the mountains, and carrying back from them to the
banks of the Osage and Kansas rivers a plentiful cargo of
beaver and other valuable skins. Having concluded his
harangue, he opened before them the largest (although the least
precious) of the bales brought from the câche, which he
divided equally amongst them, so that each warrior knowing
what belonged to him, might use it as he thought fit; the
remaining bale he ordered to be carefully secured in wrappers
of hide, and to be reserved for negotiations for the benefit of
the whole band. The Osages were loud in their approbation
of the speech, and of the liberal distribution of presents by
which it had been accompanied, and they retired from his
lodge to make immediate preparations for departure.</p>

<p>While these were rapidly advancing, Mahéga, who had
made himself thoroughly familiar with the neighbouring
locality, considered and matured his plans for retreat, the chief
object of which was to mislead the Delawares, in the event of
their attempting a pursuit. The result of his meditations he
confined to his own breast, and his followers neither wished
nor cared to know it, having full reliance upon his sagacity
and judgment. Meanwhile, Prairie&ndash;bird remained quietly in
her tent, grateful for the deliverance of her young brothers,
and indulging in a thousand dreamy visions of her own escape,
contrived and effected by Reginald and War&ndash;Eagle. These
were suddenly interrupted by the entrance of Lita, who, while
engaging in carrying water from the brook, had gathered from
one of the Osages some intelligence of what was going forward.
If the truth must be told, this Indian, separated from
the woman&ndash;kind of his own tribe, had begun to look on the
expressive gipsy countenance of the Comanche girl with an
eye of favour; and she not being slow to detect the influence
which she had acquired, encouraged him just enough to render
him communicative, and willing to offer her such attentions
as were admissible in their relative situations. Yet in her
heart she scorned him as a “dog of an Osage,” and though he
knew her to be only a slave, there was something in her
manner that attracted him in spite of himself; it was not
difficult for the quick girl to gather from her admirer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
news of Wingenund’s escape, and the death of the two Osages
sent to guard him; but when she heard the latter attributed
with an execration to the hand of War&ndash;Eagle, she was obliged
to avert her face, that her informant might not observe the
look of triumph that gleamed in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>Having ascertained at the same time that Mahéga was
about to strike his camp and resume his march, she rewarded
the Osage by an arch smile, that sent him away contented,
while she, taking up her water&ndash;vessel, pursued her way to her
mistress’s tent.</p>

<p>To the latter Lita lost no time in communicating what she
had learnt, and was disappointed to observe that Prairie&ndash;bird
seemed rather vexed than gratified by the intelligence.</p>

<p>“Does Olitipa not rejoice?” inquired she eagerly, “that
the scalps of the Washashee dogs who kept Wingenund prisoner
are hanging at the belt of the Lenapé chief?”</p>

<p>“Olitipa is tired of blood,” answered the maiden, mournfully,
“and the loss of his warriors will make Mahéga more
fierce and cruel to us. See already he prepares to go on a
distant path, where the eyes of War&ndash;Eagle and Netis may not
find us;” and the poor girl shuddered at the prospect of a
journey to regions yet more wild and remote, and a captivity
yet more hopeless of deliverance.</p>

<p>“Let him go where never Washashee foot stepped before,”
replied Lita, “where no trail is seen but that of the bighorn,
and the black&ndash;tailed deer: War&ndash;Eagle will follow and will
find him.”</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird smiled sadly at the eagerness of her companion,
and then desired her aid in getting their wardrobe and few
moveables ready for the expected journey. While they were
thus employed Mahéga called Prairie&ndash;bird to the door of her
tent, where she found the chief, with his arm wrapped round
with a cloth; and believing him to be wounded, she acceded
at once to his request that she would give him one of her
kerchiefs for a bandage. During the remainder of the evening
she saw nothing more of him or of his people, and she slept
undisturbed until an hour before dawn, when she was awakened
by the bustle of preparation for departure.</p>

<p>As soon as her light tent was struck and fastened to the
poles which supported it, she observed that a kind of cradle
had been constructed by the Osages, which was covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
skins, and was adapted to the purpose of carrying herself or
her moveables, when slung to the tent&ndash;poles, as well as to
convey its contents dry over any river that might obstruct
their passage.</p>

<p>The Osage party was now divided into two, of which one
was reserved by Mahéga for his own guidance, the other being
entrusted to that of Toweno: all the horses were placed under
the charge of the latter, including those carrying the packages,
and the palfrey usually ridden by Prairie&ndash;bird: this party
bent their course to the northward, and Mahéga accompanied
them a few hundred yards, repeating many instructions to
Toweno, which seemed from his earnest gesticulation to be
both minute and important.</p>

<p>The heart of Prairie&ndash;bird sank within her, when she saw
her favourite horse led away, and herself left with Lita on
foot, attended by Mahéga and four of his men: knowing,
however, the inutility of any present attempt either at resistance
or flight, she awaited in uncomplaining silence the further
commands of her captor, although she easily saw through the
mocking veil of courtesy with which he disguised his anticipated
triumph over her baffled friends. To his inquiry
whether she preferred travelling on foot to being carried in the
wicker&ndash;frame by two of his men, she replied, without hesitation,
in the affirmative; upon which he presented her with a
pair of mocassins, to be worn over her own, so ingeniously
contrived that although they did not encumber her movements
by their weight, they yet rendered it impossible that her foot&ndash;print
should be recognised, even by the practised eye of War&ndash;Eagle.
A similar pair was also placed on the feet of Lita.</p>

<p>It may easily be imagined that the Osages, during their
residence at this encampment, made various excursions for
hunting and other purposes; they had used on these occasions
old trails made by native tribes or by the bison; one of these
ran in a north&ndash;east direction, skirting the base of the high
western hills, and offering the prospect of easy travelling,
through an undulating and partially wooded country. Into
this path Mahéga struck at once, leading the way himself,
followed by Prairie&ndash;bird and Lita, the four Osages bringing
up the rear. This line of march being adopted by the cunning
chief, first, that he might have frequent opportunity of
watching and speaking with the maiden, and secondly, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
his men might be the better enabled to fulfil his strict injunction
that they should carefully remove any trace which she
might purposely or accidentally leave on the trail.</p>

<p>Such an idea did not, however, appear to have entered the
thoughts of Prairie&ndash;bird, for she followed the Osage chief with
a blithe and cheerful air, replying good&ndash;humouredly to the
observations which he from time to time addressed to her,
and pointing out to Lita the beauties of the scenery through
which they were passing.</p>

<p>It was indeed a lovely region, abounding in rock, herbage,
and magnificent timber, the latter affording an agreeable
shelter from the rays of the sun, while the fresh breeze,
blowing from the snow&ndash;capped mountains, which bounded the
western prospect, rendered the exercise of walking pleasant in
the highest degree.</p>

<p>They had followed the trail for some time without meeting
with any game when the quick eye of Mahéga detected a
mountain&ndash;deer, browsing at no great distance, and in a moment
an arrow from his bow pierced its flank; the wounded
animal bounded onward into the glade, and the chief sprang
forward in pursuit. The Osages fixed their keen and eager
eyes on the chase, muttering half&ndash;aloud expressions of impatient
discontent at being prevented from joining it. Swift
as had been the arrow of Mahéga, it was not more so than the
thought and hand of Prairie&ndash;bird, who contrived while her
guards were gazing intently on the deer and its pursuer, to let
fall unperceived a small slip of paper upon the trail: so completely
did she appear absorbed in watching the chase, that the
movement was unnoticed even by Lita, and the party continued
their way a few hundred steps when a signal from Mahéga,
now out of sight, soon brought one of his followers to assist
him in cutting up the quarry.</p>

<p>Before leaving her tent, Prairie&ndash;bird had prepared and
secreted about her person several small slips of paper, on each
of which she had written the word, “Follow,” trusting to her
own ingenuity to find an opportunity of dropping one now and
then unobserved by the Osages.</p>

<p>Such an opportunity having now occurred, it had been
successfully employed, and the maiden went forward with a
lighter heart, in the confident hope that Providence would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
cause some friendly eye to rest upon the slight, yet guiding
token left upon her path.</p>

<p>For two days Mahéga pursued his march leisurely, as if
fearless of pursuit, halting frequently to afford rest and
refreshment to Prairie&ndash;bird, and camping at night, on some
sheltered spot, where his men constructed for her protection a
hut, or bower of branches, over which was thrown a covering
of skins: before setting out in the morning this bower was
destroyed, and the branches dragged to some distance in
several directions; and Mahéga having carefully examined the
spot, was the last to leave it, in order to ensure that no indication
or trace of his fair prisoner might remain.</p>

<p>On the third day about noon they reached the banks of a
broad stream, which two of the Osages crossed immediately,
with instructions from their chief to make a visible trail in a
N.E. direction for some distance, when they were to enter
the river again at another place, and to wade or swim down it
until they rejoined him: meanwhile Prairie&ndash;bird and Lita,
with such articles as they wished to keep dry, were placed in
the light coriole or wicker&ndash;boat covered with skins, and
Mahéga guided its course down the stream, followed by the
remainder of his men: they descended the bed of the river
for several miles in this way; and although more than one
trail appeared on the banks as a crossing&ndash;place for Indians or
bison, he passed them all unheeded, until he came to a broad
track which had very lately been trodden by so many feet
that the trail of his own party could not be distinguished upon
it; here he halted until he was rejoined by the men whom he
had left behind, when they proceeded forward at a brisk pace,
towards the spot which he had appointed as the rendezvous
for his party in charge of the packages and the horses.</p>

<p>Mahéga was now in high spirits, being confident that the
precautions which he had taken would throw the pursuers off
the scent, and enable him to follow out his plans, which were
to trade during the summer, with the Shosonies and other
tribes hovering about the spurs of the mountains, procuring
from them beaver and other valuable furs in exchange for the
fine cloths and goods which he had brought from the Delaware
camp; after which he proposed to return to the northern
portion of the Osage country, enriched by his traffic, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
glorying in the possession of his mysterious and beautiful
bride.</p>

<p>Such were the projects entertained by the Osage chief, and
he brooded over them so abstractedly, that he afforded to the
ever&ndash;watchful Prairie&ndash;bird an opportunity of dropping another
of her small slips of paper unperceived; she did not neglect it,
although almost hopeless of her friends ever discovering her
path after the many precautions taken by Mahéga, and the
long distance down the course of the river, where no trail nor
trace of the passage of his party could be left.</p>

<p>On reaching the rendezvous he found his detachment with
the horses and luggage already arrived: they had come by a
circuitous route, availing themselves of several Indian trails
by the way, on one of which Toweno had, by direction of his
chief, scattered some shreds of the kerchief that he obtained
from Prairie&ndash;bird; after which he had returned upon the same
trail, and diverged into a transverse one, which had enabled
him to reach the rendezvous by the time appointed.</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird being again mounted upon her favourite palfrey,
the whole party set forward with increased speed, which they
did not relax until towards evening, when they saw in the
distance numerous fires, betokening the neighbourhood of a
populous Indian village. Mahéga then ordered a halt, and
having sent forward Toweno to reconnoitre, encamped in a
sheltered valley for the night. When Prairie&ndash;bird found herself
once more, after the fatigues of the two preceding days,
under the cover of her own tent, she looked round its small
circular limits, and felt as if she were at home! Casting herself
upon her couch of furs, she offered up her grateful thanks to
the Almighty Being who had hitherto so mercifully protected
her, and soon forgot her cares and weariness in sound and
refreshing slumbers.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">WAR&ndash;EAGLE AND HIS PARTY REACH THE DESERTED CAMP OF THE
OSAGES.—THE LATTER FALL IN WITH A STRANGE BAND OF INDIANS,
AND MAHÉGA APPEARS IN THE CHARACTER OF A DIPLOMATIST.</p>

<p class="pn">A bright sun shone upon the little valley which, twenty&ndash;four
hours before, had been deserted by the Osages, when a
tall form glided cautiously to its entrance, half concealed by
the bushes that fringed its edge. Glancing hastily around,
War&ndash;Eagle, for he it was, who was guiding his party in pursuit,
returned to announce to them his belief that the enemy
had decamped: nevertheless, the usual precautions were
adopted against a surprise. A small body of Delawares were
thrown forward to reconnoitre the neighbouring woods, under
the command of Attō, while the chief, accompanied by Reginald,
Ethelston, and the rest of the party, entered the deserted
Osage encampment; every nook and cranny among the
adjacent woods and rocks were diligently explored, and not
till then were they convinced that their crafty foe had given
them the slip. While the rest of the party were busied in
this search, the eye of Reginald Brandon rested in absorbed
attention upon the spot to which his steps had been first led,
as if by the power of instinct; it was a small plot, completely
sheltered by the rock which guarded the front of the recess;
a few holes made in the turf showed where pegs had been
driven in to secure a circular tent. “Here,” said Reginald to
Ethelston, “here is the spot trodden by her dear feet—here
have her weary limbs reposed during the long watches of the
night—here have her prayers been offered up at noon and eve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
for that rescue which we seem doomed, alas! never to accomplish!”</p>

<p>“Say not a word, my son,” said Paul Müller, laying his
hand kindly on the excited Reginald’s shoulder; “say not a
word, my son, which would seem to limit the power or the
mercy of that Being to whom those prayers were addressed.
Hope is the privilege, perseverance the duty of man; let us
faithfully use these bounties, and leave the issue to His all&ndash;wise
disposal.”</p>

<p>“I am indeed ashamed of my hasty expression, worthy
father,” said Reginald, frankly; “but I will draw encouragement
from your suggestion, and banish every desponding
thought, while there remains a chance of success, or even a
glimmering of hope.”</p>

<p>Wingenund, who had approached unobserved to the side of
his friend, whispered to him in a low voice, “Netis is right:
here it was that Olitipa sat when Wingenund was a prisoner;
she is not far, the Lenapé warriors never lose a trail.”</p>

<p>While they were thus conversing, a messenger from War&ndash;Eagle
summoned them to a consultation on the plan of pursuit
which should be adopted.</p>

<p>It may not be unnecessary to inform those who have never
been upon the prairies of the Far&ndash;west, that a trail is easily
followed when the party pursued is in full retreat, because any
indication of footsteps is a sure guide to its course; whereas,
in a camping&ndash;place, where a party has remained for a considerable
time, numberless paths are trodden in various directions
during its stay, some for hunting excursions, some for
bringing water, others for leading horses to and from their
pasturage, so that the pursuer is at a loss to discover by which
of these paths those of whom he is in pursuit have retreated.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle being well aware that Mahéga was not less
skilled than himself in all the stratagems and devices of Indian
warfare, set about this difficult task with a deliberation that
did not suit the eager temper of Reginald Brandon; nevertheless,
he had so much confidence in the sagacity of his
Indian brother, that he restrained all expression of his impatience,
and agreed without objection to the method proposed
by him at the council. Agreeably to this plan, Paul Müller,
Perrot, and several of the hunters and Delawares, remained
on guard at the camp, while the main body, divided into small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
parties of two or three in each, were to explore every trail
that offered a probability of success, and to return before
nightfall to report the result of their search. War&ndash;Eagle set
out, accompanied by Attō; Reginald was joined by Ethelston
and Baptiste; the other parties took the respective quarters
assigned to them, and Wingenund, who remained some time
after they had started, left the camp alone.</p>

<p>The trail followed by Reginald and his friends led towards
the upper part of the valley, over broken and bushy ground,
intersected here and there by streamlets, and small springs,
which just afforded water enough to soften the herbage, in which
they were soon lost. Had he been less absorbed by the object
of the expedition, Reginald could not have failed to admire
the tranquil beauty of this sheltered and secluded spot; but
the rich foliage of the forest trees, the merry chirrup of the
birds, the fragrance exhaled by the numberless shrubs and
flowers, the tempting clusters of wild raspberries, scattered
around their path,—all these were passed unheeded by men
whose senses and faculties were centered only on <i>the trail</i>.
With equal modesty and good sense, Reginald had desired
Baptiste to take the lead, knowing that the sturdy forester’s
experience in such matters was far greater than his own.</p>

<p>After they had marched a considerable distance in silence,
Reginald inquired the opinion of his guide.</p>

<p>“Why, you see,” replied the latter, “the Osages have
driven their horses several times this way to feed, and their
marks are plain enough; but if a man may judge by the looks
of the country forward, this is not likely to be the right trail.
It seems to get smaller the further we go; and I’m inclined
to think it’s only been a hunting&ndash;path into the woods.”</p>

<p>After this unsatisfactory observation, Baptiste again went
forward, until he stopped at the skeleton of a deer; the same,
it may be remembered, as was mentioned in a former chapter.
Here all traces of a further trail ceased, and the disappointed
Reginald exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Baptiste, your suggestion was only too correct; we have
lost our time; let us return, and search in some other direction.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, Master Reginald,” replied the cautious guide;
“there’s as many tricks in an Indian’s brain as there are holes
in a honeycomb. The animal has been dead some time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
unless this grass deceive me, it has been trodden within these
two days. Voyons vîte, as they say up north. Stand quite
still: and you, too, Master Ethelston, keep on that side of the
deer’s bones, while I have a bit of a hunt after the wood
fashion.”</p>

<p>So saying, the guide, resting the “Doctor” upon the
skeleton, and throwing himself upon his knees, began to turn
over the leaves, and to examine minutely every blade of grass
and fallen twig, muttering, as he pursued his task, “If War&ndash;Eagle,
or one of his double&ndash;sighted Delawares were here, he
would pick out this trail in no time. My eyes are not so good
as they were some years back; but they will serve this purpose,
however! This is only bungling work, after all: one—two;—yes,
I think there’s been two of them. Capote!
they’ve strewed sticks and leaves over the back&ndash;trail!” And
the rough woodsman as, creeping forward on his knees, he
discovered each succeeding step on the trail, hummed snatches
of an old Canadian song, the only words of which that the
two friends could distinguish, being, “Vogue, vogue, la bonne
pirogue!”</p>

<p>“Has it not often been a matter of surprise to you,” said
Ethelston in a whisper to Reginald, “that the language, and
even the dialect of the guide so constantly varies? Sometimes
he speaks very intelligible English; at others, his phrases
and exclamations are mostly French; and, on other occasions,
he mingles the two most strangely together.”</p>

<p>“I confess,” replied Reginald, “the same thought has often
occurred to me; yet it is not, perhaps, so strange as it would
at first sight appear, when we remember the vicissitudes of
his early life, the number of years that he spent in youth
among the French boatmen and traders of the northern lakes,
his excursions with them into the country of the Upper Sioux
and the Chippewyan nations; while for the last fifteen years
he has been much employed by my father, and, from his honesty
and trustworthy qualities, has been thrown a great deal into constant
intercourse with persons of respectability and education.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Baptiste having ascertained the direction of the
trail, cast his eyes forward, and, like a shrewd reasoner, jumped
to his conclusion,—in this instance, more correctly than is
usually the case with the persons to whom he has been likened.
Pushing aside the bushes which grew at the base of a rock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
he soon observed a large aperture, closed by a stone of corresponding
dimensions. This last was, with the aid of Reginald,
soon displaced, and the “câche” of the Osages, together with
the plundered treasure it contained, was exposed to view.</p>

<p>“So, so!” chuckled the guide, “we have found the thieving
fox’s hole;—an’ they do not cover their trail somewhat
better from the eyes of War&ndash;Eagle, we shall have their skins
before three nights are over; why, a town lawyer could have
treed this coon!”</p>

<p>Reginald and Ethelston could not forbear laughing at the
low estimation in which the woodsman held the ferreting
powers of a town lawyer,—an estimation so contrary to that
entertained by those who have any experience in the capacity
of a class so unjustly depreciated. They resolved to carry
with them to the camp the whole contents of the cave, with a
view to their being forthwith appropriated and disposed of by
War&ndash;Eagle, now the chief of the tribe.</p>

<p>Three large blankets were easily tied into the form of so
many sacks, of which each threw one over his shoulder, and
they returned with their recovered spoil to the encampment.</p>

<p>Great was the surprise of the Delawares when they saw the
three white men coming in, hot and weary with their load;
greater still, when the blankets were opened, and their contents
laid out upon the turf, among which were found lead, powder,
cloth, knives, beads, paint, medicine&ndash;bags, and a variety of
small articles, plundered from the lodge of the unfortunate
Tamenund, and those adjoining. Among these were a few
books and instruments belonging to Prairie&ndash;bird and Paul
Müller, all of which were immediately delivered over to the
latter.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle’s party was already so well supplied with necessaries
of every kind, that only a small portion of the goods
was required for their use; and the chief, after permitting
every man to claim anything which might have belonged to
himself or his relatives, ordered the remainder to be packed
in bales of convenient size, so that they might be either
carried with them, or concealed, as circumstances might render
advisable.</p>

<p>The council was opened by War&ndash;Eagle, who desired the
several parties, who had been out in different directions, to
state the result of the search. This was done with the brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
simplicity usually observed by Indians on such occasions. But
nothing of importance was elicited; for of the trails which
they had examined, none seemed to be that pursued by the
Osages in their retreat. During the speech of one of the
Delaware warriors, Wingenund, who had not before made his
appearance, noiselessly entered the circle, and taking his place
by the side of Reginald, leaned in silence upon his rifle.</p>

<p>Baptiste, whose age and experience entitled him to speak
and who suspected that the chief had not been altogether unsuccessful
in his search, addressed him thus:—“Has War&ndash;Eagle
no word for his warriors? Grande&ndash;Hâche and Netis
have found the stolen goods: has the path of the thief been
dark to the eyes of the chief?”</p>

<p>“The foot of War&ndash;Eagle has been on the Washashee trail,”
was the calm reply.</p>

<p>A murmur of satisfaction ran through the assembly, and
Reginald could scarcely restrain the open expression of his
impatient joy.</p>

<p>“The trail is fresh,” continued the chief: “not more than
two dews have fallen on the prints of foot and hoof.”</p>

<p>“Did my brother see the foot&ndash;marks of Olitipa and the
Comanche girl?” inquired Reginald, hastily.</p>

<p>“He did not; but he saw the trail of Olitipa’s horse; iron
is on two of its feet.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>During this conversation, Wingenund more than once looked
up in the face of his white brother, then cast his eyes again
upon the ground without speaking. The expression of the
youth’s countenance did not escape the observation of War&ndash;Eagle,
who thus addressed him: “Has the young warrior of
the race of Tamenund seen nothing? He has been far over
the prairie; his step was the last to return to camp; his eyes
are not shut: there are words in his breast; why are his lips
silent?”</p>

<p>The youth modestly replied, in a voice, the singularly musical
tone of which charmed and surprised Ethelston, who had
seldom heard him speak before, “Wingenund waited until
warriors who have seen many summers, and travelled the war&ndash;path
often, should have spoken. Wingenund has been on the
Washashee trail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>At this announcement an exclamation of surprise was uttered
by several of the bystanders, for all had seen that the direction
whence the youth had returned to the camp was quite
different from that which had been pursued by War&ndash;Eagle,
and yet the latter had affirmed that he had been on the trail of
the enemy. The chief himself was, indeed, surprised, but he
knew the diffidence, as well as the acute sagacity of the young
speaker; and although confident that he was not mistaken in
his own judgment, he was not by any means disposed to overrule,
without careful inquiry, that of his brother. The conversation
between them was thus pursued:—</p>

<p>“Were there horses on the trail found by Wingenund?”</p>

<p>“There were not.”</p>

<p>“Were the men many in number?”</p>

<p>“Wingenund cannot surely say; the trail was old and
beaten; buffalo had passed on it; of fresh marks he could
not see many; more than four, not so many as ten.”</p>

<p>“Let my brother point with his finger to the line of the
trail.”</p>

<p>The youth slowly turned, cast his eye upward at the sun,
thence at the rocks overhanging the valley to the northward,
and then pointed steadily in a north&ndash;easterly direction.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle, well assured that his own observation had been
correct, and that he had followed a trail leading towards the
north&ndash;west, thus continued: “There are many nations and
bands of Indians here; a false light may have shone on the
path. How does my young brother know that the feet of the
Washashee had trodden it?”</p>

<p>There was a natural dignity, without the slightest touch of
vanity, in the manner of the youth, as he replied: “The
Great Spirit has given eyes to Wingenund, and he has learnt
from War&ndash;Eagle to know the mocassin of a Washashee from
that of a Dahcotah, a Pawnee, a Shawano, or a Maha.”</p>

<p>After musing a moment, War&ndash;Eagle continued, “Did my
brother find the foot of Olitipa and the Comanche girl on the
path?”</p>

<p>“He could not find the mark of their feet, yet he believes
they are on the path,” was the unhesitating reply.</p>

<p>Reginald and Ethelston looked at the speaker with undisguised
astonishment; and War&ndash;Eagle, although he could not
believe but what the latter was mistaken, continued thus to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
question him: “My brother’s speech is dark; if he could
find no trail of the women, why does he think that they are
on the path? Have the Washashee carried them?”</p>

<p>“Not so,” replied Wingenund. “Twice the trail crossed
a soft bank of sand, where water runs from the mountains in
winter: there were the marks of two who had passed lately,
their feet large as those of the warriors, the tread light as that
of a woman or young boy.”</p>

<p>The chief was very reluctant to say or do aught that might
give pain to his young brother, whose future success as war&ndash;leader
of the Lenapé had ever been the object of his fondest
hopes; but in the urgent business in which they were now
engaged, he felt that all other considerations must be secondary
to the recovery of Olitipa, and revenge on Mahéga for the loss
and disgrace inflicted on the Lenapé.</p>

<p>“My brother has eyes as sharp, and feet as light, as a
panther,” he said in a kindly tone, “but a trail in this strange
country may deceive a man who has been on the war&ndash;path for
twenty summers. The trail followed by War&ndash;Eagle goes
through that small valley between the hills,” pointing to the
north&ndash;west. “Attō was with him; they knew the iron hoof
of Olitipa’s horse; they found this scrap, torn from her dress
by a bramble stretching across the path. Is my brother
satisfied?”</p>

<p>As the chief spoke he held up before the council a shred of
a silk kerchief, such as none, certainly, except she whom they
sought, was likely to have worn in that region. Again a
murmur of approbation ran through the assembly; and Reginald,
vexed that his young friend should have been subjected
to such a disappointment, looked towards him, in order to see
whether he bore it with equanimity.</p>

<p>The countenance of Wingenund underwent not any change,
save that a quiet smile lurked in the corner of his mouth, as
he replied, “My brother and Attō are both known on the war&ndash;path;
their feet are swift, and no lies are found on their lips;
it must be true that they have seen the hoof&ndash;print of Olitipa’s
horse; it is true that the piece of dress torn off by the bramble
belonged to her. Very cunning are the Washashee wolves;
they have tried to blind the eyes of the Lenapé; they have
made two paths; let my brother follow that which he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
found and Wingenund the other; perhaps they joined beyond
the mountain.”</p>

<p>“There is sense in what the lad proposes,” said Baptiste,
who had listened attentively hitherto, without speaking, and
who remembered the acuteness shown by Wingenund near the
banks of the Ohio. “If he is sure that he has been on the
Washashee trail, ’tis like enough they have divided, to throw
us off the scent; they will come together again further north.”</p>

<p>Again War&ndash;Eagle mused in silence for a few minutes; then
abruptly turning towards Reginald, he inquired, “What is the
thought of Netis?”</p>

<p>“I think,” replied the latter, “that Wingenund would
never have spoken as he has spoken, were it not that he felt
assured of all that he said. I would venture my life, and
what is now far dearer to me than my life, on the truth of his
words.”</p>

<p>The youth looked gratefully at the speaker, and a smile of
gratified pride stole over his eloquent countenance.</p>

<p>“It is enough,” said War&ndash;Eagle, with dignity, “let Wingenund
go upon his path; he shall not go alone. Which path
does my brother Netis choose? he has heard all that has been
said?”</p>

<p>Reginald was sorely puzzled: on one side was the sagacious
experience of the chief, added to the strong evidence afforded
by the shred of silk; on the other, the confident assurance of
a youth, of whose diffidence and acuteness he had seen so many
proofs. While he was still hesitating, he saw the eyes of the
latter fixed upon him with an earnest, imploring expression,
that decided him at once.</p>

<p>“I will go with my young brother,” he said firmly;
“Grande&ndash;Hâche, Ethelston, and six men shall go with us;
War&ndash;Eagle, with the rest of the party, shall go on the large
Washashee trail that he has struck. Let the chief say how we
shall meet beyond the mountain, if either of the trails prove
false.”</p>

<p>“It is good,” said War&ndash;Eagle; “Attō shall lead the warriors
who go with my white brother, and before the third sun
rises we will come together again, and talk of what we have
seen.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the chief waved his hand to intimate
that the council was dissolved; and calling Wingenund and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Attō aside, he gave them clear and rapid instructions as to the
course to be pursued in case of the trails diverging to opposite
quarters, and he established at the same time various signals,
to be used in case of necessity.</p>

<p>Pierre and M. Perrot asked and obtained leave to join
Reginald’s party; most of the horses, and all the spare baggage,
followed that of War&ndash;Eagle, who led them off through
the defile in the mountains before alluded to, while Wingenund
led the way to the trail which he had discovered, with the
light springy step of an antelope, and an expression of bright
confidence on his countenance, which communicated a similar
feeling to those who might otherwise have been disinclined to
trust themselves to the guidance of a youth on his first war&ndash;path.</p>

<p>While these things were passing in the allied camp, the
Osage named Toweno, who had, it may be remembered, been
sent forward by Mahéga to reconnoitre, returned on the following
morning to his chief, bringing him intelligence that the
fires seen at a distance were those of a numerous band of
Upsarokas: he had crept near enough to recognise them as
such by their dress, the trappings of their horses, and other
indications not to be mistaken. On receiving this information,
Mahéga revolved in his mind various plans for gaining the good
will of his dangerous neighbours, and of securing their alliance
as a protection against any further hostilities that might yet
be attempted by those in pursuit of his trail. As he had often
before profited by the shrewd advice of his follower, so did he
invite him now to give his opinion as to the best course to be
adopted; and in order that the discussion might not be overheard,
he walked slowly with Toweno down a glade which led
towards the Crow camp.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far, when they saw a fine bison&ndash;cow
coming directly towards them: from her languid and
crippled movement, it was evident that she was wounded;
while from her struggles to get forward, it was equally clear
that she was pursued. The Osages lost not a moment in
crouching below the cover of a thick bush; and scarcely had
they done so, when a mounted Indian appeared, urging his
tired horse up the glade after the wounded cow. It happened
that she fell, unable to proceed further, not many yards from
the spot where Mahéga was concealed; and her pursuer slackening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
his pace, approached leisurely; and having shot another
arrow into her side, despatched her with the long knife which
hung at his belt.</p>

<p>He was a tall, fine&ndash;looking man, in the prime of life, with
remarkably high cheek bones, an aquiline nose, and a mass of
long hair, gathered or clubbed at the back of his head; his
hunting&ndash;shirt and leggings denoted by their ornaments a
warrior of rank in his tribe, and his whole appearance and
bearing were indicative of habitual authority.</p>

<p>The little steed which had borne him, and which in truth
would have been termed among white men a pony, stood
panting beside its master, whose weight seemed entirely disproportioned
to its size and strength; and the Crow hunter
now stooped over the bison&ndash;cow, examining her condition and
her fat with the attention of a practised Indian gourmand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, half a minute sufficed for Mahéga to explain his
intentions in a whisper to his follower, and less than half a
minute sufficed to carry them into execution. Rushing together
upon the Crow while he was stooping with his back towards
them, they seized and pinioned him before he had time to
catch up his knife or to offer the least resistance. Never was
there an attack more unexpected, nor a victory more easily
obtained; and the discomfited Crow looked upon his two captors
with an astonishment that he could not conceal. Their
dress and tribe were altogether strange to him; and the scouts
around the camp having brought in no report of any suspicious
appearance or trail having been discovered, it could not
be wondered at if he imagined that they must have pounced
upon him from the clouds.</p>

<p>As soon as Mahéga had assured himself that the hands of
the prisoner were securely tied, he led him towards a spot
more sheltered from observation, Toweno following with the
horse; and if the Crow felt at first any uneasiness respecting
their intentions towards him, it must have been soon dispelled,
as the Osage chief assured him, in the language of signs, that
no harm was intended to him, and that he would soon be at
liberty.</p>

<p>After a short consultation with Toweno, the chief determined
to conduct the prisoner to his camp, on reaching which
his arms were unbound, and he was courteously invited to take
a seat by his captors. The Crow obeyed without any apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
reluctance, having satisfied himself by a hasty glance
around that he was watched by several well&ndash;armed men, and
that any attempt at escape or resistance must be for the present
hopeless of success.</p>

<p>The pipe of peace having been smoked between the Osage
and his prisoner, some meat and cakes were placed before the
latter, of which he partook without hesitation; but he could
not resist casting sundry curious glances at the white tent,
wondering what it might contain; he observed also the
numerous packs and bales scattered around, and thought
within himself that, whatever might be his own fate, many
of these would ere long fall into the hands of his tribe.</p>

<p>As soon as he had finished his meal, Mahéga resumed the
conversation in the language of signs, explained to him that
he wished to become friends with the Upsaroka; that he had
come from very far with few followers, having fought with the
Pale&ndash;faces; that the tent was Great Medicine, and contained
that which brought wealth and good things to friends, but
terror and misfortunes to enemies.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that the Upsaroka did not, in his present
circumstances, regret these peaceful overtures; on the
contrary, he bound himself by the most solemn promises to
do every thing in his power towards establishing friendship
between their respective tribes, and he gave Mahéga to understand
by his gestures that he was not without authority among
the Crows.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Upon receiving this assurance the Osage chief suffered his
prisoner to depart, restoring to him his horse, and presenting
him with several trinkets in token of friendship.</p>

<p>The first use which the latter made of his recovered liberty
was to invite Mahéga to return with him to the Upsaroka<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
village, an invitation which, to the surprise of his followers,
he accepted without hesitation.</p>

<p>With a parting caution to Toweno to keep his men watchful
and ready against a surprise, he threw a battle&ndash;robe<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> over his
broad shoulders, and, armed with his rifle, tomahawk, and
knife, accompanied his new ally towards the Crow village.</p>

<p>On approaching it, he found that it consisted of more than
a hundred lodges, containing, probably, two hundred men,
besides women and children.</p>

<p>Great was their surprise when they saw the gigantic stranger
advancing with his conductor towards the lodge of the principal
chief, to whom he was nearly related.</p>

<p>The mien and bearing of the Osage, as he entered the lodge,
were alone sufficient to secure for him a courteous invitation
to sit in the place of honour; while the Crow who had been
his prisoner briefly narrated to the head chief the circumstances
under which the stranger visited his camp.</p>

<p>The pipe of friendship having been smoked in due form,
the Crow chief whispered a few words in the ear of a youth
beside him, who disappeared immediately, and the party sat in
silence until he returned, accompanied by an individual whose
appearance was singular in the extreme: his head was of an
enormous size, and covered with black shaggy hair; his features
were coarse and forbidding, nor was their expression
improved by a patch of leather plastered over the cavity which
had once been occupied by his left eye; his shoulders were
broad, and his arms of unusual length; his stature was scarcely
five feet, and his legs were bandy, with clumsy knees, like those
of a buffalo&ndash;bull: this unsightly ogre rejoiced in the name of
Besha&ndash;ro&ndash;Kata, signifying, in the Crow language, “the little
bison,” but he was commonly called “Besha,” or the “Bison,”
the diminutive termination being omitted.</p>

<p>His origin was involved in a mystery that neither he nor
any one else could satisfactorily explain, for he had been born
in that wild region watered by the Arkansas, and his mother,
a Comanche woman, was said to have divided her favours,
previous to the birth of Besha, between a half&ndash;bred trader to
Santa Fé, and a runaway negro from one of the southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
slave&ndash;states; she died while he was yet an infant; and as he
had never been owned or claimed by either of his reputed
fathers, it was a miracle that he ever lived to manhood.</p>

<p>In his early years he hovered about the hunting parties of
Osages, Comanches, Pani&ndash;picas, and other tribes, who frequented
the region where he had been left to shift for himself,
and at other seasons none knew whether he lived upon roots,
berries, and honey, or wandered to tribes yet more remote
from his birth&ndash;place. He was never known, either in summer
or winter, to wear any other dress than a bison&ndash;skin with the
hair outwards, in the centre of which he cut a hole, and passing
his head through the aperture, wore this uncouth skin like
the Poncha of the Mexicans. From these early rambling
habits, he had picked up a smattering of many Indian dialects,
and of these the Osage was one with which he was the most
familiar; he enjoyed a high reputation among the Crows, not
only from his being often useful as an interpreter, but because
he was, without exception, the most skilful horse&ndash;stealer in the
whole region between the Arkansas and the mountains. He
was also deeply versed in the knowledge of all the properties
of plants, roots, and herbs, so much so, that, unless fame
wronged him, more than one of his enemies had died by the
agency of subtle poison. Such was the personage who, fixing
his single cunning eye upon Mahéga, inquired, on the part of
the Crows, his object in paying them a visit. The conversation,
rendered into English, was in substance as follows:—</p>

<p><i>Besha.</i> “Has the Washashee come to hunt and trap among
the Stony Mountains?”</p>

<p><i>Mahéga.</i> “He has not; he has come towards the setting
sun, because the enemies on his path were too many for him—he
wished for peace.”</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “Has the Washashee a name in his tribe?”</p>

<p><i>M.</i> “He has a name; when the war&ndash;post is struck,
Mahéga is not silent,” said the chief, haughtily.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “Mahéga!” repeated the horse&ndash;stealer, to whom the
name was evidently not unknown. “Mahéga, the Red&ndash;hand!—does
he wander so far from his village?”</p>

<p><i>M.</i> “He wanders, but there is Great Medicine in his
lodge; blood has been on his path, and his enemies do not
laugh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p><i>B.</i> “Whom are the men with whom Mahéga has dug up
the hatchet?”</p>

<p><i>M.</i> “Pale&ndash;faces, and cowardly red&ndash;skins, who are their
friends.”</p>

<p>When this reply was translated, a great sensation was visible
among the Crows, several of whom whispered together. After
receiving a few instructions from the chief, Besha proceeded
with his inquiry.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “Are the Pale&ndash;faces on the trail of Mahéga?”</p>

<p><i>M.</i> “They are.”</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “How many?”</p>

<p><i>M.</i> “Mahéga does not know.”</p>

<p><i>B.</i> “Is there a pale&ndash;faced warrior with them,—young and
tall, riding a dark horse, very swift and strong?”</p>

<p><i>M.</i> “There is,” said the Osage, astonished in his turn at
hearing Reginald thus accurately described by the interpreter.</p>

<p>Again there was a murmur, and consultation among the
Crows, after which Besha thus proceeded:</p>

<p>“What is the wish of Mahéga? the Upsaroka ears are
open.”</p>

<p>M. “He wishes to make friends with them, to join his
strength to theirs, to drive these Pale&ndash;face thieves out of the
Crow country. Mahéga’s warriors are few, but they are not
squaws; his hands are not empty; he has presents for the
chiefs, and he will not forget the interpreter.” He added,
sinking his voice almost to a whisper, “He has many things,
enough to make the tribe rich, hid in a cave far to the south;
if the Crow will be his brother, he shall find that Mahéga has
an open hand.”</p>

<p>The cunning chief was aware of the thieving propensities
of the Upsaroka, and he purposely threw out this last hint that
they might be induced to spare his baggage, in the hope of
ultimately possessing themselves of the more important treasure
in his “câche.” Nor was his stratagem without effect, for
the discovery and possession of the contents of that câche
became forthwith the principal object of the Crow chief; and
the readiest mode of attaining it was to make friends with the
party who could alone guide him to it.</p>

<p>Fortune had in this instance been more propitious to Mahéga
than he deserved; for, as the reader has probably conjectured,
he had fallen in with that very Upsaroka band, a detachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
of which had been so roughly handled a few days before by
Reginald Brandon and the Delawares under his command.</p>

<p>The high contracting parties being thus united by the strong
ties of avarice, and revenge against a common enemy, an
offensive and defensive alliance was entered into immediately.
Mahéga soon discovered the motive which impelled his new
friends so strongly to espouse his cause, and was thereby satisfied
that, for the present at least, he might trust them. Before
nightfall, the white tent of Prairie&ndash;bird was pitched at the
edge of the Upsaroka camp, and the Osages took up their
quarters around it, so that none could leave or enter it unperceived
by them.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning Mahéga received a visit
from the Crow chief, who, accompanied by Besha, came ostensibly
to show him courtesy, but in reality to inspect his packages,
horses, men, and equipments; and, if possible, to solve
the mystery of the Great Medicine in the white tent. The
Osage warriors, strong, weather&ndash;beaten men, every one provided
with a rifle in addition to the usual arms of an Indian,
had no reason to fear the scrutinising eye of the Crow; indeed,
the latter began already to calculate how he might best avail
himself of their aid in an expedition which he meditated
against his hereditary enemies the Black Feet.</p>

<p>After the pipe had been smoked, and food set before his
guests, Mahéga desired one of the smaller packages to be
opened, from which he selected a blanket, and spreading upon
it various beads and trinkets, presented the whole, in token of
friendship, to the Upsaroka chief, who seemed highly delighted
with the gift.</p>

<p>His expressions of gratitude, conveyed through Besha, were
unbounded. He did not, however, think it requisite to express,
at the same time, his vehement desire to become the possessor
of all the goods and chattels belonging to the Osage; neither
did the latter forget to propitiate the interpreter, whom he presented
with a knife and ornamented sheath, both of which
were graciously accepted.</p>

<p>The Crow was resolved not to leave the spot until he had
solved the enigma of the mysterious tent; and finding that
his guest still kept silence on the subject, he directed Besha to
use his best exertions towards the gratification of his curiosity.
An opportunity being afforded by the appearance of Lita, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
went out to draw some water from the stream, the interpreter
inquired whether that woman was the “Great Medicine” of
which he had spoken.</p>

<p>Mahéga, who was desirous of impressing the Crows with a
due respect for Prairie&ndash;bird, shook his head, replying, “That
is the slave of the Great Medicine.”</p>

<p><i>Besha.</i> “Is the Great Medicine a chief—a wise man?”</p>

<p><i>Mahéga.</i> “No: it is in the form of a woman; but its
power is very great. It talks with the Great Spirit, and the
Wahconda<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> listens to its speech!”</p>

<p><i>Besha.</i> “Many are the medicine&ndash;men who talk with the
Great Spirit; they see dreams, and give counsel to the warriors
and chiefs; there is no new Medicine here.”</p>

<p>“My brother speaks truth,” said Osage, smiling scornfully.
“But if the medicine&ndash;men of the Upsaroka call to the sun, will
he come out of his path, or hide his face at their words?”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, Mahéga lowered his voice, as if afraid
of being overheard by the mysterious tenant of the tent, and
related to the wondering Besha the circumstances attending
the late eclipse.</p>

<p>The interpreter having given the explanation to his chief,
they looked at each other in speechless astonishment; for not
only was there an air of truth in the statement of Mahéga, but
the Crows having themselves observed the mystery of the
darkened sun, were thereby led to listen with believing awe to
the wonderful disclosure made by the Osage.</p>

<p>Perceiving his advantage, the latter again relapsed into
silence, which was broken, after a few minutes, by the interpreter,
who inquired, on the part of his chief, whether the
Great Medicine of the tent would receive a present from him.
To this the cautious Osage replied, that the daughter of the
Unknown cared not for the things belonging to other women;
but that her smile and her good words would bring prosperity
to those with whom she dwelt, while her curse would ensure
their destruction; on which account it would not do any harm
if the Upsaroka were to offer a present to her Medicine.</p>

<p>The latter now finding that, during this visit at least, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
curiosity would not be gratified by a sight of the mysterious
dweller in the tent, arose, and took a courteous leave of the
Osage chief, who remained for some time ruminating abstractedly
over his future plans, and the probability of their ultimate
success.</p>

<p>Scarcely half an hour had elapsed ere Besha returned,
accompanied by two young Indians, one of whom led a wild
horse, which he presented on the part of his chief to Mahéga;
and the other was the bearer of a large package of beaver&ndash;skins
of the finest quality, which he laid down at the door of the
tent, and retired, casting back uneasy glances, apparently relieved
at having safely executed a commission fraught with
danger.</p>

<p>Mahéga presented each of the youths with a handsome
knife, and Besha with a mirror, wherein he contemplated his
cyclopean countenance with undisguised satisfaction; so long,
indeed, did he continue this admiring self&ndash;inspection, that the
two young Crows left him engaged in it, and returned to their
quarters.</p>

<p>They had not been long gone before the interpreter commenced
a confidential conversation with the Osage chief, during
which each endeavoured, with little success on either side, to
overreach the other: at the same time, the conference was not
without its satisfactory issue to both parties; for Mahéga
ascertained that the Crows viewed the mixed band of Whites
and Delawares with feelings as hostile as his own, and that
they were as deeply impressed as he could desire with awe for
the mysterious powers of Prairie&ndash;bird. On the other hand,
Besha satisfied himself that his own services would be almost
indispensable to the Osage, and that the latter was neither unwilling
nor unable to reward them liberally; so that after a
complimentary conversation of some length, these two rogues
parted, with many expressions of mutual regard and esteem.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the interpreter out of sight, when Mahéga
sprung from the ground to examine more closely the steed
presented to him by the Crow chief. It was a strong, high&ndash;mettled
bay colt, untamed, and almost untameable; if the truth
must be told, the latter had given it to his guest because neither
he nor any of his warriors could subdue its violent and vicious
spirit, although the Crows are renowned among the Indian
nations as bold and expert horsemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>On whatever side Mahéga endeavoured to approach to mount
it, the horse struck fiercely at him, using both hind and fore
feet with equal rapidity; but the Osage, penetrating at once
the motives of the Crow’s liberality, smiled in disdain of the
shallow trick, and, seizing his opportunity, threw himself
upon the wild, unsaddled animal, despite of whose furious
plunging and resistance, he sat unmoved like a centaur; and
plying his whip and heel with unmitigated severity, compelled
it to gallop at full speed over the prairie, until he thought fit
to bring it back to the camp, wearied, breathless, and subdued.
Then throwing the halter to one of his men, he quietly resumed
his pipe, leaving the Crow chief and his people to draw their
own conclusions from what they had seen.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">CONTAINING VARIOUS INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED TO THE PARTY
FOLLOWING THE TRAIL.—PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS, AND A DISCUSSION
UPON ORATORY, WHICH IS VERY MUCH OUT OF PLACE, AND,
FORTUNATELY FOR THE READER, IS NOT VERY LONG.</p>

<p class="pn">There is scarcely any position or occasion in life more gratifying
to a young and generous spirit, than when it finds itself,
for the first time, entrusted with a high responsibility. The
elastic mind, far from succumbing under the unwonted burden,
springs upward with increased vigour to resist its pressure; and
the trials and difficulties which threaten to overwhelm it, only
serve to call forth and multiply its energies. Such was the
case with Wingenund, who now found himself, although not
yet seventeen years of age, leading a gallant band on a trail—a
task which is at all times the greatest trial of an Indian warrior’s
skill; and, if successful, lays the foundation of his fame.
The issue at stake was, in this instance, heightened by the importance
of the object to be attained, and by the remarkable
circumstance that he had ventured to differ from, and overrule,
the opinion of his elder brother, the most sagacious warrior of
the tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>Fully impressed with the serious responsibility that he had
incurred, the youth set forth upon the trail with a gravity of
demeanour which contrasted strongly with his almost boyish
years. Yet while his keen eye darted from point to point,
suffering not a blade of grass to escape its scrutiny, his countenance
wore a beaming look of confidence, that imparted its
cheering influence to the whole party.</p>

<p>For some hours he marched rapidly forward, with the assured
step of a man who was treading a familiar path. Attō
followed at no great distance, next to whom, on the trail, came
Reginald, with Ethelston, Baptiste, and the other Whites, the
line being closed by the Delawares, who brought up the rear.
It may easily be imagined that Reginald bent his eyes anxiously
on the path; but although frequent traces were discernible
of the passage of men, as well as of various animals,
he could not discover the slightest indication of the marks for
which he looked; neither did the observation of the more experienced
Baptiste meet with any better success.</p>

<p>When Wingenund reached the streamlet, on the sandy edge
of which he had before noticed the light tread of a foot, which
in spite of its dimension, he believed to be that of Prairie&ndash;bird
or her attendant, he halted the party, and summoned
Attō to a close examination of the trail. Stooping over it, the
Indian looked long and earnestly, after which he shook his
head, as if dissatisfied, and muttered a few words, the meaning
of which Baptiste was not near enough to catch. Wingenund
made no reply, and crossing the brook resumed the trail on its
opposite bank.</p>

<p>“Does Attō find the mark of women’s feet on the sand?”
inquired Baptiste.</p>

<p>“He is not sure; bison have passed over the marks, and
trodden them,” was the evasive reply, and the party proceeded
on the track.</p>

<p>Nothing of any importance occurred for some time to enliven
the tedium of the march. The sanguine hopes of Reginald
had been checked by what had fallen from Attō, of whose
acuteness he justly entertained a high opinion. Ethelston
seemed buried in deep reflection; and even the comic sallies
of Monsieur Perrot failed to excite any mirth in those to whom
they were addressed.</p>

<p>“Ethelston, I fear that I acted imprudently,” said his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
friend in a low voice “when I preferred the counsel of this
youth to the more experienced opinion of War&ndash;Eagle; yet
there was something in his manner that I could not resist.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” replied Ethelston, “the counsel of the elder
warrior was entitled to the greater weight; and yet I do not
think that he would himself have placed this detachment under
the guidance of Wingenund, unless he felt sure that the latter
had strong grounds for the tenacity with which he clung to his
opinion.”</p>

<p>“I would willingly peril my life on his truth and fidelity,”
said Reginald. “The question is, whether on this occasion he
may not have been led into some error by the very eagerness of
his wishes, and the ardour of his temperament.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he uttered these words, when Wingenund
stooped to pick up a small object which his quick eye had
caught beside the trail; in another minute he placed it in the
hand of Reginald, while a triumphant smile lit up his animated
features. The object referred to was a slip of folded paper,
damp with the dew which had fallen upon it. Reginald
opened its folds, then gazed upon it in silence, with a fixed
look, like one in a trance, while his powerful frame trembled
from head to foot. The paroxysm of excitement lasted but
for a moment, then putting the slip of paper into the hand of
Ethelston, he threw himself into the arms of Wingenund;
and if a tear escaped him, it fell unseen upon the bosom which
he pressed with grateful affection to his heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ethelston made himself master of the secret
which had produced an effect so sudden as to cause the greatest
astonishment in the whole party, now gathered round to ascertain
what had happened. He had read on the slip the magical
word “Follow,” written in a distinct legible hand, and every
doubt as to the Prairie&ndash;bird having passed along the trail
vanished in an instant. This was no sooner made known to
the hunters, and by Baptiste to the Delawares, than a shout of
triumph from the whole party roused Reginald from the momentary
weakness into which he had been betrayed.</p>

<p>“Follow thee!” he exclaimed aloud, holding the paper in
his left hand, and grasping a rifle in his right; “Follow thee,
dearest one! yes, over prairie and mountain, through valley
and river, in cold or in heat, in hunger or thirst, there are
those here who will never cease to follow thee, until thou art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
set free, and the injuries done to thyself and thy kindred
dearly avenged!”</p>

<p>Again a shout of sympathetic enthusiasm broke from the
party, as they caught the words of their leader, and read on his
glowing countenance the intense ardour of feelings, too strong
to be repressed.</p>

<p>What must have been, in the meantime, the sensations of
the Delaware youth? The affectionate yearnings of his heart
towards his adopted brother, his deep anxiety for his sister’s
fate, his future fame as the rising war&ndash;chief of his tribe, all
these combined together to swell the triumph of the hour; yet
there was not visible in his features the slightest appearance
of gratified pride or vanity; and if his dark eye beamed with
a brighter lustre, it was not so much with self&ndash;congratulation
at what he had done, as with high aspirations for the glorious
task before him.</p>

<p>Ethelston, who had watched him closely, was surprised at
his calm, unmoved demeanour, and whispered to Baptiste,
“Wingenund evinces little anxiety or emotion on this occasion;
and yet this undoubted token which he has found on the
trail must be a great triumph to him, after the doubts expressed
by so many warriors of greater experience.”</p>

<p>“It’s partly the natur’, and partly the trainin’ of the boy,”
replied the guide, leaning on his long rifle; “the stronger his
feelings the less will he show ‘em to another man. I reckon
this has been one of the proudest moments in his life, yet, as
you say, he looks almost as if he’d nothin’ to do with the
matter; and he’d look the same if the Osages were pinchin’
his flesh with hot tongs. Wingenund is three years older now
than he was last month!”</p>

<p>“You are right,” Baptiste, replied Ethelston: “it is not
days, nor weeks, nor months, but rough trials, brave deeds,
and deep feelings that make up the calendar of human life.”</p>

<p>So saying, he sighed, and musingly resumed his place in the
line of march, remembering in how short a space of time
Nina’s unrequited love had, while she was still younger than
the lad of whom he was speaking, consigned her, wasted and
heart&ndash;broken, to the grave.</p>

<p>Again Wingenund moved swiftly forward on the trail, and
the whole party followed, their hopes excited, and their
spirits raised by the occurrence above related. Reginald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
walked silently on, still clasping in his hand the magic token
which had conjured up hopes and thoughts too deep for utterance.
From time to time his lips unconsciously murmured
“Follow!” and then the idea shot like fire through his brain,
that all his power to obey the dear behest hung upon the sagacity
of the youth who was now tracing the steps of an enemy,
skilled in all the wiles of Indian warfare, and whose object it
clearly was to baffle pursuit.</p>

<p>Before the close of day the watchful perseverance of Wingenund
was again rewarded by finding another of the slips of
paper dropped by Prairie&ndash;bird, which he brought, as before,
to Reginald. The magic “Follow” again met his longing
eyes; and as he announced it to the rest of the party, a joyful
anticipation of success pervaded every breast.</p>

<p>After a brief consultation with Attō, Wingenund now resolved
to halt for the night, as the increasing darkness rendered
it impossible any longer to distinguish the trail with
accuracy; so the horses were picketed, the succession of sentries
arranged, and the party bivouacked under the shelter
of two enormous pines, where the preparations for a substantial
supper were soon completed, Monsieur Perrot taking
charge of that destined for Reginald and Ethelston, while
Bearskin and the other hunters prepared a meal for themselves
and the Delawares apart. Wingenund was about to join the
latter party; but at the earnest request of the two friends, he
placed himself beside them, Baptiste being invited to sit down
with them also.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that the conversation turned chiefly
upon the all&ndash;engrossing subject of the pursuit in which they
were engaged; and Ethelston was struck by the change
which he observed in the demeanour of Wingenund; for the
latter had now put off the gravity and somewhat haughty
bearing of the aspiring warrior, and had resumed the playful
and touching simplicity of manner that was natural to his
years, and accorded equally well with the almost feminine delicacy
of his features and the soft melody of his voice. He
took no pains to conceal the pleasure with which he received
the warm and sincere encomium that Reginald passed upon
the patience and sagacity that he had displayed in his arduous
task.</p>

<p>“Netis owes me no thanks,” he said, smiling. “Love for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
my sister, and revenge on the Washashes, who like cowards
and false friends slew my kindred,—these lead me on the
trail.”</p>

<p>“It is not your eagerness, nor the strength of your motives
that I call in question, dear Wingenund; but I am surprised
that you are able to follow so slight a trail without being deceived
by the tricks and devices of the Osage.”</p>

<p>“The Black Father has often told me that among the
southern men there are dogs who can follow the foot of a
man by day or night, and will never leave the scent till they
seize him. If an antelope is wounded, the wolf will hunt the
track of her blood on the prairie till he finds her; if a bison
is killed, turkey buzzards, many in number, fly from far to
to the carcass, though there is no trail in the air for them to
follow. Is it wonderful that the Great Spirit should bestow
on the son of his ancient people a gift enjoyed by these beasts
and fowls?”</p>

<p>“What you say is true,” replied Reginald, “yet certainly
we who live in settlements have not these faculties; at least we
have them in a very inferior degree.”</p>

<p>“The wise men of our nation have always said that the
eyes and ears of white men are not good; but the Black
Father says that their speech is not true, for that the Great
Spirit has made the ears and eyes of red and white men
alike, only the Pale&ndash;faces do not improve them, as we do, by
use.”</p>

<p>“Your Black Father may say what he likes,” interposed
Baptiste, “but I maintain that the ears of a white man are no
more like the ears of a real Ingian than the paws of a bear
are like the legs of an antelope. I remember, though it’s now
some twenty years ago, I was out on a hunt in the North
with a Delaware comrade; he was called in the tribe, ‘The&ndash;man&ndash;who&ndash;hears&ndash;from&ndash;far;’—to
say truth, I thought he often
pretended to hear things that never happened, only just to
keep up his name. We had walked all the morning, and
having killed an elk, sat down to cook it on the prairie. All at
once he held up his finger for me to keep silence; and turning
his head to listen, his countenance changed, and his ear pricked
up like that of a scared doe. Nay, Master Reginald, you
need not smile, for it’s as true as a gun&ndash;barrel; and said I,
‘What’s the matter now?’ He made no answer, but went a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
little way off; and lying down, put the side of his head to the
ground. He soon returned, and told me that ‘a big canoe
was coming over the lake.’—‘What,’ said I, ‘over that lake
we passed this morning beyond those high woods?’—‘Yes,’
he replied, ‘the same; I hear the paddles dip in the water.’
I laughed in his face, and told him he was dreaming; for the
lake was, may be, two miles off; but he declared that he had
heard the paddles as plain as he now heard my voice. I tried
to listen, but could not hear a sound; however, I knew that
if he was right, the canoe would be full of enemies, seein’ that
we had no particular friends then in the Dahcotah country,
and I thought it better to believe him for once: so we put
more sticks on the fire, to make as great a smoke as we could,
and then ran off to the top of a hill, where a big pine&ndash;tree
grew; and as it was about half&ndash;way between the fire and the
lake, we clomb in among its branches, where we could have a
good look&ndash;out on both. We remained some time without
hearing or seeing any thing; and I began to conceive that my
comrade had made a fool of me, as well as of himself, when we
saw five or six Sioux devils peep out of the brush at the edge
of the prairie, where they pointed to the smoke that rose from
our fire, and began to creep cautiously towards it.”</p>

<p>At this point the narrative of the guide was unexpectedly
interrupted by a sharp cry uttered by Monsieur Perrot, who
jumped up from his seat, and capered like a harlequin, making
at the same time the most doleful grimaces and ejaculations.
Wingenund was the first to perceive and to explain to Reginald
the cause of the unfortunate valet’s distress, in doing
which he laughed with such hearty inexpressible mirth, that
the tears started from his eyes.</p>

<p>It appears that Monsieur Perrot, in his anxiety to hear
Baptiste’s adventure, had unconsciously edged himself nearer
and nearer to the fire, by the side of which was a small pile
of dry burrs and prickly adhesive twigs; while sitting upon
these, and listening intently to the narrative, they had become
accidentally ignited, and not only burnt him as he sat, but
adhered to his nether garments when he jumped up, where
they continued to crackle and smoke in spite of the efforts
which he made to disengage himself from them. To add to
his terror, he remembered at this critical juncture that there
was a powder&ndash;flask in the hinder pocket of his jacket; a circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
which he communicated to his master with renewed
exclamations, and unavailing attempts to rid himself of the
dangerous magazine. On hearing this, Ethelston emptied a
vessel full of water over a blanket that lay beside him, in
which he immediately enveloped the alarmed valet, and by
this ready application of one element freed him from the more
serious danger to be apprehended from the other.</p>

<p>As soon as the gravity of the party was in some degree
restored, Reginald requested the guide to conclude the narrative
which had been so unexpectedly interrupted, expressing
at the same time his curiosity to learn how Baptiste and his
comrade had extricated themselves from their unpleasant position
among the branches of the pine&ndash;tree.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, Master Reginald, as soon as they were
fairly busied in making their way to the fire which we had
left burning, we slipped down the tree, and struck into the
wood, where we had no difficulty in finding their back&ndash;trail
to the lake, and creeping cautiously towards the shore, we
found that the hot&ndash;headed fools had left no one to watch
their canoe, which we spied under the boughs of an alder that
hung over the lake; so we just stuck a piece of stick in the
ground, with a Delaware mark on it to vex ‘em on their return,
when we paddled away to the other side; and having bored
two holes in the canoe, and broken the paddles, we went on
our way; and since that time I’ve always held my own opinion
about an Indian’s ears, and I’m not likely to change it
now.”</p>

<p>Whether the guide’s story was tedious, or that the fatigues
of the day had produced their effects upon his hearers, certain
it is, that soon after its conclusion both the ears and eyes
of the greater portion were closed in sleep; and nothing
having occurred during the night to alarm those who had
watched, the whole party set forward as soon as daylight broke
on the following morning.</p>

<p>Wingenund had no difficulty in making out the trail until
he reached the banks of the river, in crossing which Mahéga
had taken so much pains to mislead his pursuers. Here the
youth halted, and informed Reginald that he might look for
game during the remainder of the day, as it would be necessary
for him and Attō to search for War&ndash;Eagle’s party, and
with them to find the right trail on the opposite bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>The two Delawares started at a rapid pace to the westward,
bestowing as they went careful attention on various tracks
of bison and other animals which had crossed at the different
fords that they passed. After a toilsome march of some
hours, they fell in with War&ndash;Eagle’s party, whom they found
occupied in a like investigation. The chief learnt his young
brother’s success with undisguised pleasure; his nature was
too noble to entertain a thought of jealousy; and one of the
first wishes of his heart was to see Wingenund take his place
among the first warriors of the tribe. He had ascertained
beyond a doubt, that although the horses of the Osages had
crossed the river opposite to the trail which he had been following,
they had not travelled far in that direction, but had
returned to the bed of the river for the obvious purpose of
baffling pursuit; and the Delawares now crossed to the
northern bank, and after minute examination of every path and
track which led from it, they arrived in the evening at the
point from whence Wingenund started, confident that the
right trail must, if the Osages had crossed at all, be at some
spot lower down the stream.</p>

<p>The whole party, now again reunited, encamped for the
night, and related, over their evening meal, the indications and
tracks which they had remarked on their respective lines of
march. At the earliest dawn War&ndash;Eagle was again afoot, and
after an hour’s patient search, he struck a trail, which he pronounced,
without hesitation, to be that of the Osages. As it
led through a wooded and hilly region along the base of the
Great Mountains, abounding in narrow and dangerous passes,
every precaution was used against ambush or surprise; War&ndash;Eagle,
Wingenund, and Attō leading the advance, with
several of the most swift and skilful of their warriors, and
the white men, who brought up the rear, being cautioned
against straggling or falling behind the main body.</p>

<p>Another slip of paper found upon the trail, bearing Prairie&ndash;bird’s
inspiring watchword “Follow,” raised the spirits of the
party to the highest pitch. They halted at midday to refresh
themselves and their horses for an hour under the shade of
some spreading cedars, above which rose a high conical peak,
on the sides of which were scattered a few dwarf oaks, and
other timber of stunted growth. Obeying a signal from War&ndash;Eagle,
Reginald climbed with him to the summit of this hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
whence they could command an extensive view of the sand&ndash;hills
and undulating ocean of prairie to the eastward, while above
them to the westward towered the lofty and still distant
mountain&ndash;tops, clad in their bright mantle of eternal snow.</p>

<p>But it was not to enjoy the splendour of this magnificent
prospect that the Delaware had toiled up this steep ascent, or
that he now cast his restless and searching eye towards the
north and east horizon: he had another object in view. Neither
did he seem to have altogether failed in its attainment, for after
gazing long and intently upon a spot to the northward, his
countenance brightened, and he desired Reginald, who was
unable to distinguish so distant a speck with the naked eye, to
examine it carefully with his telescope, for that he would
see something there that would make his heart beat.</p>

<p>Reginald did so, and having succeeded in catching the indicated
object with his glass, he exclaimed, “War&ndash;Eagle, my
brother, you are right, I can see them plainly, one—two—three—aye,
twenty Indian lodges, and <i>the white tent</i> among
them. Heaven be praised for all its mercies, we shall save
her yet!”</p>

<p>For a few moments the chief was silent; then he said, “Let
my brother use the glass again, and say how many lodges he
can count.”</p>

<p>“There seem to be very many,” said Reginald, after a
careful survey, “more than fifty, but I cannot count them, for
the tent is on a small hill, and some may be hid behind it.”</p>

<p>“Mahéga smokes the pipe with a powerful tribe,” said the
Delaware, musing; and the two friends descended the hill, each
contemplating, according to the bent of their respective characters,
the difficulties yet to be encountered, and the means by
which those difficulties might be overcome.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it must not be supposed that Mahéga remained
in idle security a resident in the Crow encampment; he appreciated
too justly the skill and perseverance of War&ndash;Eagle to
suppose that the latter would not strike and follow his trail,
he therefore turned his attention to the strengthening of his
alliance with his new friends by every means in his power. In
this endeavour his own sagacity was admirably, though perhaps
unconsciously, seconded by the winning manners and character
of Prairie&ndash;bird; for the Crows, who had been prepared to look
upon her with a feeling akin to dread, were agreeably surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
by her extreme beauty, and the gentleness of her demeanour.</p>

<p>The cunning Osage, knowing that she could only be drawn
from the strict seclusion in which she lived by her never&ndash;failing
willingness to alleviate suffering, had caused several children,
and others afflicted with illness, to be brought to her, and she
never declined giving them such remedies from her remaining
stock of medicine as she thought most likely to afford relief.
The general success of her simple pharmacy fully answered
the expectations of Mahéga, in the increasing anxiety daily
evinced by the Crows to guard and protect the “Great Medicine”
of the tent; and thus, while obeying the dictates of
her own gentle and humane feeling, the maiden little knew
that she was strengthening the cords of her captivity.</p>

<p>Neither did Mahéga neglect to take every precaution
against an attack or surprise on the part of War&ndash;Eagle and
his party. Although ignorant of their precise force, he knew
that they would in all probability be well armed, and was far
from satisfied with the position of the present encampment
occupied by the Crows.</p>

<p>After conversing once or twice with Besha, and the judicious
admixture of a few presents to that <i>dis</i>interested personage, he
learnt that there was at a distance of half a day’s march to the
northward a favourite stronghold of the Crows, to which they
frequently resorted when attacked by an enemy too numerous
to be resisted in the open plain, and it was represented to be
in a neighbourhood affording abundance of game, and a plentiful
supply of pasture for the horses.</p>

<p>Mahéga found it not a very difficult task to persuade the
Crow chief to withdraw to this post, representing to him the
formidable equipment of the Delawares aided by their white
allies, and he urged him also to send a few of his best runners
to hang about the trail by which he had himself arrived, so
that timely notice of the enemy’s approach might be received.</p>

<p>The Crow acquiesced in both suggestions, and the united
band moved off accordingly to the post above referred to,
which they reached in the afternoon of the same day; it was
a conical hill, covered on one side with low juniper bushes,
and rising suddenly out of the prairie at a distance of several
miles from the higher range of mountains to the west; a few
hundred yards further to the east was another height of similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
elevation, but of less circumference, and between these two lay
a valley of extreme fertility, watered by a stream so cool and
clear, that it bespoke at once the mountain source whence it
flowed; the eastern side of this second hill was almost perpendicular,
so as to be secure against any attack from that quarter;
while an enemy approaching from the valley would be exposed
to missiles shot from either height.</p>

<p>Mahéga saw at a glance the strength of the position, and
proposed to the chief that he, with his Osages, should garrison
the smaller height, leaving the larger hill and the intermediate
valley to be occupied by the Crows.</p>

<p>This arrangement being agreed upon, the tent of Prairie&ndash;bird
was pitched near the summit, on a spot where the ground
gently sloped to the westward, and a few scattered oaks, cedars,
and pines afforded not only a partial shelter from the rays of
the sun, but a sufficient supply of fuel for cooking the venison
and bison&ndash;meat, which the hunters had brought in abundantly.
Some twenty lodges of the Crows were placed upon the opposite
and larger height; these consisted chiefly of the principal
braves and warriors; the intermediate valley being
occupied by the remainder of the band; and an ample space
was left for picketing the horses at night between the two
hills.</p>

<p>On arriving at her new quarters, Prairie&ndash;bird could not
avoid being struck by the singularity as well as by the beauty
of the scenery. It was evident that the face of the sandstone
rock, above which her tent was pitched, had been eaten away
by the action of water and the elements; and she imagined
that ere many years should pass, the precipitous cliff on its
eastern front would partially fall in, and leave in its place a
broken and turreted ruin, such as she had before noted and
admired on the western borders of the great prairie. It was
a great relief to her that she was so much by herself; for the
lodge of Mahéga and his followers was pitched somewhat
lower down the hill than her own tent, and she was yet further
removed from the dirt and other annoyances of the Crow
lodges. This was, indeed, a great luxury, as the quantity of
bison&ndash;meat brought into the camp on the first day’s hunt
was so great, that the Upsaroka women were spreading and
drying it in every direction; and as these ladies are not
usually very particular in removing the offal, the odour thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
arising in the valley below was not the sweetest that could be
imagined.</p>

<p>Mahéga was in high good humour in consequence of the
successful result of his arrangements; for he now occupied a
post not only well protected against the attack of an enemy,
but where his baggage could not be purloined by the light&ndash;fingered
youths, who are so proverbially abundant among
the Crows. But however secure he might feel, he did not
relax his usual vigilance, in which he was zealously seconded
by Toweno; and whenever the one was absent from the
garrison, even for a short time, the other always remained at
home on the watch. He renewed, also, a rude breastwork of
unhewn logs, which had been thrown up by the Crows on
some former occasion, and which afforded a shelter, from
behind which he and his men could fire upon an approaching
enemy without being themselves exposed.</p>

<p>They had not long been settled in their new quarters before
the detachment which had been sent to reconnoitre returned
to report that they had seen the united band of white men and
Delawares, about thirty in number, advancing cautiously along
the base of the hills towards the Upsaroka camp. The
scouts had recognised Reginald as the person who had killed
one of their principal warriors; and the announcement of his
approach was received with a yell that showed how determinately
the Crows were bent on revenge.</p>

<p>A war&ndash;council was immediately held, which Mahéga was
summoned to attend; and although the wary Osage kept himself
in the background, and showed no disposition to offer his
advice until twice pressed by Besha to do so, it was soon evident
that his spirit would rule the meeting, and that on him
would devolve the conduct of the struggle in which they must
soon expect to be engaged: such was the impression already
made upon his new allies by his gigantic stature, and the air
of command that accompanied his every word and gesture.</p>

<p>Unless the advantage of numbers was to be very great on
his side, Mahéga did not augur favourably of the result of an
open conflict between the Crows and the small but well&ndash;appointed
force opposed to them. He formed a just estimate
of the skill and sagacity of War&ndash;Eagle, and of the impetuous
courage of Reginald Brandon. He hated both, especially the
latter, with all the bitter intensity of which his nature was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
capable; and resolved that no stratagem should be left untried
to heap upon them every species of suffering and disgrace.</p>

<p>With this view, he conferred long, through the medium of
Besha, with the leading warriors of the Crows as to the
nature of the ground in the neighbourhood of the enemy’s
line of march; being determined, if possible, to lead them
into an ambush; or at least to attack them in some defile or
pass, where the bow and arrow would be a better match for
the rifle than in the open plain. Not being altogether satisfied
with the replies which he received, he declined giving his
opinion until he should have reconnoitred the district in
person, and set forth without delay, accompanied by the
dwarfish interpreter and two Crow warriors, all being mounted
on swift horses.</p>

<p>Having reached the base of the first range of hills, the Crow
who acted as guide struck into a narrow winding ravine; after
following the course of which for some distance, the party
emerged upon an elevated table land, which they crossed at
full speed, and found themselves at the base of a second range
of hills, more broken and abrupt than the first. Here the
guide and Mahéga dismounted, and having concealed the
horses, and left them behind the projection of a rock in charge
of the other two, they climbed with some difficulty to the brow
of a sandstone cliff, whence they could command an extensive
view of the region to the southward.</p>

<p>Creeping cautiously to the edge of the height, and screening
themselves behind the junipers and scanty bushes growing
there, they could easily distinguish the camp of the Delawares
and white men in the valley below. The band had come to a
halt, and were evidently engaged in refreshing themselves and
their horses with their midday meal.</p>

<p>The Osage chief glared upon them like a tiger on his anticipated
prey. He examined the ground in front and rear and
flank of their position; he noted the breadth of the pass where
the valley opened out upon the plain beyond, and questioned
his guide closely as to the route which they would probably
take in advancing towards the Crow encampment.</p>

<p>We will leave him for a time to pursue these investigations,
while we return to Reginald and War&ndash;Eagle, whom we left
deliberating as to the most advisable course to be pursued for
the rescue of Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill398" id="ill398">ill398</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>The Delaware chief having been soon informed by his scouts
of the enemy’s retreat to another and stronger position, lost
no time in pushing forward his party to the point in the valley
where it had (as above mentioned) been descried by Mahéga
and his guide. Reginald and the other white men were at a
loss to imagine why War&ndash;Eagle had selected for his halt a spot
where a dense thicket on the side of each hill seemed to offer
to an enemy, familiar with the country, a favourable opportunity
for attacking him unawares; and even Baptiste, when
questioned upon the subject, shook his head, saying: “Wait
till to&ndash;morrow; we shall know by that time what hole the coon
is making for.”</p>

<p>As for the Delawares, they ate their bison&ndash;meat and smoked
their pipe with as much indifference as if they were in the
heart of their own hunting&ndash;ground, being confident in the skill
of their leader, from the experience of many a foray and fight.
The latter, having thrown forward two or three of his men as
outposts, to guard against surprise, summoned Wingenund, to
whom he gave, in an earnest voice, some minute directions,
which did not reach the ears of others in the party; and the
youth, as soon as he had received them, went up to Reginald,
and said to him, “Will Netis lend Nekimi to Wingenund?
He will be back before the moon is up,—and if he meets the
Upsarokas, he must leave them behind.”</p>

<p>Reginald testified his willing assent to the youth’s request,
and in a few minutes Nekimi was bounding over the prairie
beneath his light burthen with a speed that soon brought him
to a point whence he could command a view of the two heights,
upon and between which the Crows were encamped.</p>

<p>The sand&ndash;hills in that region project in many places from
the base of the Great Mountains into the open plain, like the
promontories of an indented shore into the ocean, and it was
by skirting one of these until he reached its extremity that he
contrived to watch the encampment of the Crows without
being observed by their scouts; for several hours he stood motionless
by the side of Nekimi, under the shade of a pine, with
that untiring patience which renders an Indian unequalled as
a spy, when he saw four horsemen emerge from the camp, and
gallop off towards the base of the mountains. As soon as they
entered a valley where they were screened from his view, he
put Nekimi to his speed, and by a shorter cut reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
head of the same valley before them; then leaving his horse
behind a thicket of junipers, he crept forward, and hiding
himself in some brushwood, waited for the passing of the
horsemen.</p>

<p>As the roughness of the ground had compelled them to
slacken their speed, he had no difficulty in recognising Mahéga,
but the features of the misshapen interpreter and the Crow
warriors were, of course, strange to him. He watched the
Osage chief and his companion as they climbed the hill, from
the top of which they made their observations of the Delaware
camp; and as they returned and remounted their horses, they
passed so near to his hiding&ndash;place that the youth distinctly
heard two or three words which Mahéga spoke to Besha in
the Osage tongue. As soon as they were out of sight he hastened
to the spot where he had left Nekimi, and returned at
full speed to make his report to War&ndash;Eagle.</p>

<p>The chief had evidently been awaiting with some impatience
the return of his messenger, and when he received the intelligence
which the latter brought back, he said, “It is well, let
Netis and the chiefs be called to council—there is no time to
lose.”</p>

<p>A few minutes sufficed to assemble the leaders, who were
expected to take a part in the deliberations about to be entered
upon, all of them being well aware of their vicinity to the
enemy of whom they had so long been in pursuit; but when
called upon to express their opinion as to the course to be
adopted, a manifest reluctance prevailed, arising probably from
the wild and rugged nature of the region, and from their ignorance
of the strength of the band with which Mahéga had
allied himself. After a brief pause, Baptiste, who was thoroughly
versed in the character of the Delawares, arose and said,
“Are the tongues of the warriors tied? the sun will not stay
in his path, neither will the grass grow beneath the feet of the
Washashee and Upsaroka; the white men and the Lenapé
wait to hear the voice of the Great Chief—let War&ndash;Eagle
speak.”</p>

<p>Thus called upon, the Delaware leader came forward to
address the council. He painted the wrongs that his tribe
had suffered at the hands of the Osages, the treachery and
cruelties practised on their wives and children; then he dwelt
on the spoiling of their lodges, the abduction of Prairie&ndash;bird,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
and the attempted murder of Wingenund. Having thus
roused the passions of his Delaware hearers, he gradually
brought them back to a calmer state of reflection, by representing
to them the dangers and difficulties of their present position,
owing to the alliance formed by their implacable enemy
with the Upsaroka, who knew every pass and dangerous defile
of the country through which they were marching, and he impressed
upon them the necessity of their having recourse to
stratagem in order to make up for their deficiency in numbers
and in local knowledge. He then proceeded to unfold his
plan of operations, which (as afterwards explained by Baptiste
to Reginald and his friend) was nearly in the following
words:—</p>

<p>“Mahéga and the Upsaroka will attack our camp to&ndash;night—the
wolf shall fall into a trap—they will come to take
scalps, let them look after their own—but we must divide our
party—Wingenund has seen the Washashee camp, he shall
guide ten warriors to it in the dark, and while Mahéga is leading
his blind followers here, the tomahawk and the fire shall be
in his lodge!”</p>

<p>A deep murmur of approbation satisfied the chief as to the
sentiments of his stern and determined band; and Ethelston,
although he knew not the meaning of the words which had
been uttered, was struck by the dignity with which they had
been spoken, and by the rich and varied intonation of War&ndash;Eagle’s
voice.</p>

<p>“Reginald,” said he, “how much I regret that I could not
follow your Indian brother in his discourse. His attitudes
brought to my mind the orators of old, as represented to us by
classic pen and chisel: it seemed as if I could almost gather
his meaning from his eloquence of eye and tone!”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Reginald, “whether the merit of
oratory consists in action, as held by the ‘old man eloquent
who fulmined over Greece,’ or in the art of persuasion, by
convincing the judgment while moving the passions of the
hearers, as held by the best authors who have since written on
the subject, War&ndash;Eagle possesses it in an eminent degree.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ethelston, “I admit the persuasive power,
and the action at once graceful and commanding, but I maintain
that there is yet a stronger element, the mention of which
you, and the authors whom you quote, have strangely neglected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
namely, truth; that immortal essence, which pervades the
whole intelligent creation, before which falsehood shrinks
abashed, and sophistry vanishes into vapour. This it is that
guides the winged words of man direct to the heart of his brother;
by this, and this alone, did the voice of Luther triumph
over the thunders of the Vatican, and beneath its mighty influence
the haughty Felix trembled before the captive apostle.
This is, if I mistake not, the secret of your Indian friend’s
oratory; every word that he utters finds an echo in the breast
of those whom he is addressing. The injuries that he recounts
are recent; the dangers against which he warns them are real
and present; and the vengeance to which he guides them, they
pant for with a thirst ardent as his own.”</p>

<p>“Far be it from me,” replied Reginald, “to disparage the
might and majesty of truth, or to doubt that in the end it must
triumph over error and falsehood, as certainly as Good shall
obtain the victory over Evil. Nevertheless, I hold, that as the
object of eloquence frequently is to ‘make the worse appear the
better cause,’ and to guide the hearers, not so much to their
own real good as to the immediate purpose of the speaker,
there are some occasions, where he will more effectively attain
it by working on the prejudices, frailties, and passions, than
he could by the most direct appeal to justice or to truth. If
Felix trembled at the denunciations of Paul, the bolder and
mightier spirit of Wallenstein quailed before the wily astrologer,
who pretended to have interwoven his destinies with the
mysterious movements of the planets.”</p>

<p>“I see the scope of your argument, Reginald, and acknowledge
its force. It is because men obey the dictates of passion
more willingly than those of conscience, that they are more
easily led by the factious sophistry of a Cleon than by the virtuous
wisdom of a Socrates. Nevertheless, you will not deny
that even sophistry and faction bear testimony to the might of
truth, by putting on her semblance, and disguising themselves
as her followers, thus do they achieve success, until they encounter
some champion strong enough to unmask and detect
them; as the Trojans fled before Patroclus clad in the armour
of Achilles, until Hector pierced his disguise, and killed him.”</p>

<p>“Is it not strange,” said Reginald, laughing, “that in this
wild and remote region, and amidst its wandering tribes, we
should renew discussions, which we so often held together in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
early days on the banks of the Elbe and Rhine! I remember
that you generally beat me in argument, and yet permitted me
to retain possession of the field of battle. On this occasion
I think we must draw off our forces, and neither claim the
victory. The Indians are already preparing for the night’s
expedition, and interests so dear to me depend upon its result,
that I look forward to it with the deepest anxiety. If War&ndash;Eagle
is correct in his calculation, that the Osages and their
allies will attack our camp to&ndash;night, it is uncertain whether
they will carry Prairie&ndash;bird with them, or leave her behind
under a guard. We must be prepared for either plan; and in
dividing our force arrange it so, that if we succeed, she may
be sure of falling into the hands of those fit and authorised to
protect her. I will take with me Wingenund, and our steady
friends Baptiste and Pierre: do you remain with War&ndash;Eagle,
Paul Müller, and the main body reserved for the defence of
the camp.”</p>

<p>“Be it so,” replied Ethelston, “I trust we shall not be
long separated, and that before this hour to&ndash;morrow we shall
have rescued your betrothed from her captors.” He added,
with a smile, “Remember that in our German expedition you
made me many promises of discretion, which in the excitement
of action you were somewhat apt to forget; you must
not do so now that you are engaged in the cause of one, to
whom your life is perhaps dearer than it is to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Baptiste himself shall not be more cautious than I will
be,” replied Reginald, grasping his friend’s hand; and they
parted to make the requisite preparations for their respective
duties.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">A SCENE IN THE TENT OF PRAIRIE&ndash;BIRD, WHO GIVES SOME GOOD ADVICE,
AND RECEIVES IN A SHORT SPACE OF TIME MORE THAN ONE
UNEXPECTED VISITOR.—THE CROWS LED BY MAHÉGA ATTACK THE
DELAWARE CAMP BY NIGHT.—THE DEFEATED PARTY ACHIEVE A
KIND OF TRIUMPH, AND THE VICTORS MEET WITH AN UNEXPECTED
LOSS.</p>

<p class="pn">The evening passed away with the rapidity usual in that
western region, where twilight has no sooner thrown its dusky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
hue over mountain and plain, than it again yields its place to
the darker gloom of night; and yet it were a libel upon nature
to call by the name of gloom that uncertain light in which
that mighty landscape reposed. The moon was half full, and
her beams, scarcely piercing through the deep foliage of the
wooded vale, streaked with silver lines its mossy herbage; eastward
lay the vast expanse of undulating prairie, on which
countless herds of bison lazily cropped the dew&ndash;sprinkled grass,
while high above the scene towered the gigantic peaks of the
Western Andes slumbering in a light as cold and pale as their
own eternal snow.</p>

<p>Nothing was heard to disturb the reign of silence save the
distant murmur of the streamlets as they plashed from rock to
rock in their descent to the quiet river that flowed beneath;
or here and there the stealthy foot of the panther or prowling
bear. A few stars glimmering in the vault above, and clouds
of ever&ndash;varying shape flitted athwart its surface, now hiding,
and again partially revealing, the dark outlines of forest, vale,
and rugged cliff.</p>

<p>It was an hour and a scene calculated to inspire thoughts of
awe, piety, and gratitude towards the Creator; of love, gentleness,
and peace towards His creatures; and yet through those
groves and glens feet more stealthy than the panther’s step,
foes more fell than the prowling bear, now wound their silent
way, bent on their secret errand of destruction and of blood.</p>

<p>In one quarter Reginald, followed by Baptiste, Pierre, and
six men, moved swiftly across the prairie, under the guidance
of Wingenund, towards the camp of the Osages; in another,
Mahéga led a numerous band through the defiles before described,
to surprise the encampment of the Delawares; while at
the latter place War&ndash;Eagle, aided by Attō and his chosen warriors,
was making all the necessary dispositions for a stratagem
by which he hoped to defeat the expected attack of his enemies.</p>

<p>It was already several hours past midnight, the moon had
withdrawn her light, and Prairie&ndash;bird was buried in the
refreshing sleep that visits the eyelids of guileless youth; Lita
slumbered on a couch of skins stretched across the entrance
of her mistress’s tent, before which at a little distance the
Osage sentry, seated by the breastwork thrown up for the
defence of the position, hummed a low and plaintive air of his
tribe. Suddenly his ear caught the sound of approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
feet, and quick as thought the arrow was fitted to his bow&ndash;string,
but he checked the hasty movement, remembering that
sentries were posted at the base of the hill, who would not
have permitted any hostile step to approach unchallenged.
As the new comers drew near he distinguished through the
gloom the figures of a man and a woman, the former short
and square&ndash;built, the latter slight and graceful.</p>

<p>“What do the strangers seek?” inquired Toweno, for he
it was whom Mahéga had left in charge of his camp, and who
now guarded the tent of Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p>“Toweno is a great warrior among the Washashee; his
voice is welcome to the ear of a friend,” replied in the Osage
tongue, the rough voice of Besha, the horse&ndash;dealer. “The
Upsaroka maiden wishes to speak with Olitipa, the Great Medicine
of the tent.”</p>

<p>“This is not a time for maidens to visit or to speak,” replied
Toweno; “the feet of the braves are on the night&ndash;path,
and many wives who sleep now will be widows ere the sun is
up.”</p>

<p>“Besha knows it well,” answered the horse&ndash;dealer; “nor
can he understand how Toweno is in the camp while Mahéga
and his warriors are on the bloody&ndash;path.”</p>

<p>“The Pale&ndash;faces are cunning,” replied the Osage, “and
Mahéga would not leave the rich skins of otter, beaver, and
bison, and the Great Medicine of the tent, without a guard.”</p>

<p>“The Pale&ndash;faces will not come near the high&ndash;camp,” said
Besha, casting a rapid glance over the bales of fur and cloth.
“Have you many warriors left with you?”</p>

<p>“Four of the Washashee, and four times four of the Upsaroka,
is the band in camp<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; but what does the woman desire
of Olitipa?”</p>

<p>“She is the youngest and favourite wife of the Upsaroka
chief,” replied Besha, lowering his voice, “and she desires a
medicine that his love for her may never change; her heart is
good towards the Washashee, and her hands are not empty.”
Here he whispered a few words to his companion, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
girl timidly extending her hand placed in that of the Osage a
small roll of tobacco.</p>

<p>The grim features of the warrior relaxed into a smile, as
his fingers closed upon the scarce and much&ndash;coveted leaf<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>, and
without further delay he moved to the entrance of the tent,
and wakening Lita, desired her to arouse her mistress for a
conference with the bride of the Upsaroka chief.</p>

<p>Although surprised at this unexpected summons, Prairie&ndash;bird
hastened to receive her visitor, supposing that some sudden
illness or accident must be the cause of her coming at such
an hour. Her simple toilet was soon made; and fastening to
her girdle the bag containing the slender stock of instruments
and trifles that she always carried with her, she stepped into
the outer compartment of the tent, and desired Lita to admit
the stranger.</p>

<p>The Crow girl, led by Besha, came forward with apparent
reluctance, obviously under the influence of the greatest terror,
and Prairie&ndash;bird was, for the moment, annoyed at the admission
into her tent of a man whom she had only seen once or
twice before, and whose appearance was forbidding in the extreme;
but quickly remembering that without him it would have
been impossible to communicate with her visitor, she desired
Lita to place three mats; and seating herself upon one, kindly
took the Crow girl by the hand, drawing her gently to that
nearest to herself; then motioning to Besha to occupy the
third, she requested him in the Delaware tongue, to explain
the object of this nightly visit.</p>

<p>“The tale of the Upsaroka maid is secret,” he replied;
“it is only for the ears of Olitipa.”</p>

<p>At a signal from her mistress, Lita, throwing a blanket over
her shoulder, stepped into the open air, and leaned against the
breastwork not far from the post of Toweno.</p>

<p>“Does the ‘Bending&ndash;willow’ wish all to be told?” inquired
Besha of his companion in a whisper.</p>

<p>Bending&ndash;willow, who had not yet dared to lift her eyes
from the ground, now timidly raised them; and encountering
the kind and encouraging glance of Prairie&ndash;bird, answered,
“Let all be told.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>Having received this permission, the one&ndash;eyed horse&ndash;dealer
proceeded to relate, with more feeling than could have been
expected from his harsh and uncouth appearance, the story of
his fair companion. She was the daughter of the principal
brave in the nation; both he and his only son had fallen
lately in a bloody engagement with the Black&ndash;feet. The
father had, with his dying breath, bequeathed his surviving
child to the protection of his chief, and the latter had fulfilled
the trust by giving her in marriage to his eldest son, a gallant
youth, who, although not yet twenty&ndash;five years of age, had
already two wives in his lodge, and had taken many scalps
from the Black&ndash;feet, against whom he was now absent on an
expedition undertaken to avenge the slain relations of his newly&ndash;espoused
bride.</p>

<p>Bending&ndash;willow, who had not yet seen eighteen summers,
was passionately fond of her young lord, who now returned
her affection with an ardour equal to her own; this had moved
the spite and jealousy of his two former wives, who took no
pains to conceal their hatred of her; and although they dared
not strike or ill&ndash;treat her as long as she remained the favourite,
they endeavoured by every means in their power to vex and
annoy her, and to bring her, by degrees, under the suspicion
and distrust of their husband.</p>

<p>It was to obtain from Prairie&ndash;bird a medicine by which she
might secure his continued affection, that Bending&ndash;willow had
made this visit; and she had come stealthily by night, in
hopes of escaping thereby the observation of her watchful
colleagues.</p>

<p>During the horse&ndash;dealer’s recital, Prairie&ndash;bird glanced more
than once at the young woman’s countenance, of which she
was enabled by the red light of the wormwood torch that
burnt near the centre of the tent, to distinguish the features
and expression; both were remarkably pleasing and attractive,
while the long black hair falling over her shoulders in two
plaits, interwoven with beads of various colours, was set off
by the delicate hue of the fawn&ndash;skin dress, which displayed
to advantage the symmetry of her slight and graceful figure.
Prairie&ndash;bird took her hand in silence, and the Crow girl fixed
her eyes with guileless and admiring wonder upon the surpassing
loveliness of the “Great Medicine of the tent,” which
struck her the more forcibly, as she had come in the expectation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
of seeing a person decked out and ornamented after the
fantastic fashion adopted among the Indian tribes by those
who pretend to supernatural powers.</p>

<p>After a brief silence, Prairie&ndash;bird, addressing her visitor
through the interpreter, said, “When the wives of the young
chief scold and speak bad words to Bending&ndash;willow, what does
she reply?”</p>

<p>“She gives them bad words again, sharper and harder than
their own,” answered the bride hastily.</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird shook her head, and continued, “Has Bending&ndash;willow
watched their faces when they scold and heap angry
words upon her? How do they look then?”</p>

<p>“They look ugly and spiteful as spotted snakes!”</p>

<p>“Bending&ndash;willow has come for a medicine to make the love
of her husband endure fresh and green as the valleys watered
by the Nebraska! Does she think he would love her if when
he returns to his lodge he hears sharp angry tones in her voice,
and sees spiteful looks in her countenance? The Great Spirit
has made her face and voice sweet as the breath of the morning;
if she makes them ugly and harsh, the medicine of
Olitipa cannot preserve her husband’s love.”</p>

<p>The Crow bride cast down her eyes, evidently confused and
puzzled by this address. At length she inquired, in a subdued
tone, “What, then, is the counsel of Olitipa? What is Bending&ndash;willow
to do when these sharp tongues scold and rail at
her?”</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird opened the volume that lay beside her, and
answered, “The words of the Great Spirit are, ‘A soft answer
turneth away anger!’ When the tongues of the women are
bitter against Bending&ndash;willow, let her give gentle words in
reply; they will be ashamed, and will soon be silent.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the quick&ndash;tempered bride, “the angry spirit
gets into the heart of Bending&ndash;willow: when fire is in the
breast, cool water flows not from the tongue!”</p>

<p>“Olitipa will give a medicine to her sister,” replied our
heroine; and opening a case that stood near her, she drew
thence a small hand&ndash;mirror. Presenting this to her visitor, she
added, “When Bending&ndash;willow finds the angry spirit in her
heart, and bitter words ready on her tongue, let her look at
her face in this medicine&ndash;glass, and say to herself, ‘Are these
the soft eyes that the chief loves to look upon?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>The bride took the glass, and contemplated her features
therein, apparently not without satisfaction. But their expression
was troubled, for she was frightened at the words which
Prairie&ndash;bird had told her were those of the Great Spirit, and
her eyes wandered from the book to the maiden, as if she
would willingly learn more of her mysterious communion with
the powers above.</p>

<p>At this crisis the wild war&ndash;cry of the Crows rang through
the tent; several shots followed each other in rapid succession,
mingled with the whistling of arrows and the clash of blows,
while loud above the din of conflict rose the voice of Toweno,
urging and encouraging his men.</p>

<p>Besha started to his feet, and rushed from the tent to learn
whence came this sudden and unexpected attack, and Lita
hastened to the side of her mistress, as if resolved to share her
fate, whatever that might be.</p>

<p>Louder and nearer came the mingled cries and yells of
battle, and a stray rifle&ndash;ball pierced the canvass of the tent,
leaving a rent in it close to the head of Prairie&ndash;bird. She
neither stirred nor spoke; and as the wailing and terrified
Bending&ndash;willow, the daughter and the bride of warriors inured
to scenes of blood, looked on the pale, calm cheek of the
Christian maiden, whose hand still rested on the mysterious
volume, she felt as if in the presence of a superior being, and
crept closer to her side for protection and security.</p>

<p>But we must leave the tent and its inmates, and turn to the
scene of strife without. The darkness of night was giving
place to the grey hue of dawn, and a faint streak of light was
already discernible in the eastern horizon, ere Reginald’s party,
guided by Wingenund, was able to reach the base of the hill
on which the Osages were posted. His intention had been to
arrive there several hours sooner; but he had been prevented
by various obstacles, such as might be expected to occur on a
night&ndash;march through so rugged and difficult a country, and
also by the necessity of making a considerable circuit to avoid
being seen by the Crows encamped, as was before mentioned,
on a hill on the opposite side of the valley.</p>

<p>Reginald had no means of ascertaining the force that might
be left to guard the camp and the tent, and it appeared rash
in the extreme to attempt by daylight the storming, with only
ten men, a position so fortified by nature, and defended by
warriors familiar with its local advantages. But his impetuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
ardour had communicated itself to all his party, and it was
unanimously agreed that the attack should be made.</p>

<p>In the sketch before given of the Osage camp, it was stated
that the hill was steep, and of a conical shape, sloping less
abruptly towards the valley, while the front that it presented
to the prairie eastward was precipitous and inaccessible. The
attacking party had made their approach from this quarter,
rightly conjecturing that it would be left unguarded. They
succeeded in gaining the base of the cliff unperceived; but in
spite of the caution with which they advanced towards the
more sloping face of the hill, they were descried by the
enemy’s outposts, who discharged at them a flight of arrows,
uttering at the same time the shrill war&ndash;cry that had startled
the party within the tent.</p>

<p>There being now light sufficient to enable the combatants to
distinguish each other, the rifles of the white men told with
fatal effect, and several of the Crows fell at their first fire;
the remainder retreated fighting, towards the breastwork above,
whither Reginald’s party pursued them with an impetuosity
not to be resisted. When, however, the Crows gained the protection
of the breastwork, they recovered from their temporary
panic, and, animated by the example of Toweno and the few
Osages with him, let fly their arrows with precision and effect.</p>

<p>The leader of the Osages, and one of his band, were provided
with rifles, and although the attacking party availed
themselves of the occasional shelter of trees and bushes in
their ascent, two of them received severe bullet&ndash;wounds from
the marksmen securely posted above. They were not unnoticed
by the quick eye of Baptiste, who, having reloaded his long
rifle, deliberately waited until the Osage beside Toweno showed
the upper part of his head above the breastwork as he aimed at
Reginald, now within pistol&ndash;shot of him. The finger of the
savage was on the trigger, when a ball from the rifle of the
guide struck him in the centre of the forehead, and with a convulsive
bound he fell dead on the spot, overthrowing in his fall
Toweno, whose rifle was thereby for the moment rendered
unserviceable.</p>

<p>“Forward! Master Reginald,” shouted the guide; “Wingenund
is already at the breastwork!”</p>

<p>Light as an antelope, and active as a mountain cat, the
Delaware youth had distanced all his companions in the ascent,
and, regardless of the fearful odds of numbers opposed to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
was already clambering over the stockade, when an arrow
pierced his arm, and a war&ndash;club, hurled with equal force and
precision, struck him on the head, and he fell backwards at
the feet of Reginald. The latter rendered desperate by the
fall of his Indian brother, caught from Baptiste the huge axe
that hung at his belt, and springing forward to the stockade,
soon hewed himself a passage through its wooden barrier—wounded
slightly by an arrow in his thigh, grazed by another
on the cheek, his hunting&ndash;cap pierced and carried from his
head, it seemed as though his life were charmed against the
missiles of the enemy—and despite every obstacle, he stood at
length within the breastwork, followed by Baptiste and his brave
companions. The guide, whose cool and wary eye noted every
movement, had reserved the fire of the pistols in his belt, and
twice, while his young master was hewing with reckless daring
at the tough barrier, had an unerring ball from <i>them</i> rendered
powerless an arm raised for his destruction.</p>

<p>Although still superior in numbers in the proportion of two
to one, the allied band of Osages and Crows were so discouraged
by the storming of their barrier, that they offered
but a feeble resistance, each endeavouring to provide for his
own safety. Toweno alone, aided by one of the bravest warriors
of his band, determined in this fatal crisis to execute
the bloody orders of Mahéga; and by a preconcerted signal,
as soon as Reginald made good his footing within the breastwork,
they rushed into the tent of Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the affray, the terrified Upsaroka
bride had never moved from the side of our heroine, on whose
countenance she fixed her anxious eyes, as if expecting from
her some display of supernatural power for their common protection;
Lita clung also to the arm of her mistress; and the
Christian maiden, trusting to that Word on which her hand
and her heart alike reposed, awaited with patient resignation
the issue of a peril, of which she knew neither the nature nor
the extent. That the camp was attacked she was well aware,
by the shouts and cries of the combatants; but who the attacking
party might be, and whether likely to fail or to succeed,
she had no means of judging.</p>

<p>Besha had from the commencement of the affray shot several
arrows from the breastwork at the invaders; but seeing
them press forward with such determined resolution, he bethought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
himself of the bride, for whose safety he was responsible,
and retired within the tent, resolved, if possible, to
withdraw her from the scene of confusion while there might
yet be time for escape; but Bending&ndash;willow obstinately refused
to quit the side of Prairie&ndash;bird, and he was still urging his
entreaties to that effect, when the two Osages burst into the
tent.</p>

<p>“Let the Medicine&ndash;woman of the Bad Spirit die,” shouted
Toweno, as he raised his tomahawk to strike; but Besha
caught the descending blow, and endeavoured to avert the
murderous weapon from his hold. Meanwhile the other Osage
advanced to execute the fell purpose of his leader, when the
devoted Lita, throwing herself in his way, clung to his upraised
arm with the strength of despair. Slight, however, was
the resistance which she could offer; and the savage, throwing
her with violence to the ground, again raised his knife above
the head of his unresisting victim. Lita shrieked aloud, and
the fate of Prairie&ndash;bird seemed inevitable, when a warlike
figure burst into the tent, and Reginald Brandon, still wielding
the axe of Baptiste, stood in the midst of the group. His
fiery glance fell upon the savage about to strike his beloved,
and swift as thought that terrible weapon descending, clove
the Indian’s skull.</p>

<p>By this time Toweno had freed himself from Besha, whom
he had rendered almost helpless by two severe wounds with
his scalp&ndash;knife, and he now flew at Reginald with the fury of
a tiger at bay; but the presence of Prairie&ndash;bird nerved her
lover’s arm with threefold strength, and parrying the blow
which his opponent aimed at his throat, he passed his cutlass
through the body of the Osage, and threw him, bleeding and
mortally wounded, several yards from the tent. At this moment
a shout of triumph without, raised by Baptiste and his
companions, assured Reginald that the victory was complete,
and that those of the enemy who survived had fled and left
him in possession of the camp. Then he cast himself on his
knees by the side of his betrothed, and as she leaned her head
upon his shoulder, a flood of tears relieved the suppressed emotions
caused by the fearful trial that she had undergone. Few
and broken were the words that passed between them, yet in
those few words what volumes of the heart’s grateful and
affectionate language were expressed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>The entrance of Baptiste recalled to the recollection of
Reginald the duties that still remained for him to perform,
while the wounds received by Besha in her defence pleaded
with the maiden for such remedies as she had within her
power. After briefly explaining to her lover the circumstances
which had brought the horse&ndash;dealer and his still trembling
companion to her tent, she sought her stock of healing
ointments and salves; while Reginald, although slightly
wounded, went out to arrange with Baptiste and Pierre for the
defence of their newly&ndash;acquired possession, and to ascertain the
loss which his party had sustained. This last was less than he
had feared it might prove; and it was with heartfelt pleasure
that he shook by the hand young Wingenund, who had recovered
from the stunning effects of the blow which he had
received in his gallant attack upon the breastwork.</p>

<p>“Let my young brother go into the tent,” said Reginald;
“rest will do him good, and the eyes of Olitipa will be glad to
see him.”</p>

<p>As the youth turned away, Baptiste added, “Let not the
man nor the Crow woman escape; we may want them yet.”</p>

<p>Wingenund replied by a sign of intelligence, and entered
the compartment of the tent where he found his sister exercising
her office of charity.</p>

<p>We will now leave Reginald Brandon and his party busily
employed in repairing the breach made in the breastwork, in
examining and strengthening all the defences of the post (which
they found much stronger than they had expected), and in
making all the requisite preparations for the attack which they
anticipated on the return of Mahéga and his Crow allies. The
booty, ammunition, and supplies found in the camp exceeded
their expectations, as in searching the Osage lodges they discovered
all the goods stolen by the latter from the Delawares.
The eyes of Baptiste and Pierre brightened at the sight of this
recovered treasure; those experienced hunters well knowing
that the Osage chief, when deprived of the means of offering
presents or bribes, would not long retain the friendship of
his treacherous allies.</p>

<p>We will now go back for a few hours, and see with what
success he met in the expedition which he undertook against
the camp of War&ndash;Eagle. So confident did he feel in its issue,
that he had prevailed upon two&ndash;thirds of the fighting men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
the Crows to join his party, promising them abundance of
scalps and plunder, as well as revenge for the losses which
they had sustained at the hands of Reginald’s band. Having
already carefully noted all the land&ndash;marks on the path by
which he meant to make his approach, he followed it with
instinctive sagacity, and a few hours’ rapid night&ndash;march along
the base of the hills brought him to the opening of the narrow
valley, at the upper extremity of which the enemy’s camp
was posted. Here they slackened their speed, and advanced
in silence with noiseless step, Mahéga stealing onward in
front, darting his quick glance from side to side, as if he
would penetrate the gloom, rendered yet deeper by the trees
and rocks, beneath which they wound their cautious way. It
was not long before he was enabled to distinguish the site of
the Delaware camp, by the ruddy glare cast by the watch&ndash;fires
on the surrounding foliage. The Osage stopped and
pointed out the welcome beacon to his followers—not a word
was spoken—every warrior there knew the preconcerted plan
of attack, and was aware that a careless step upon a dry stick
might discover and defeat it. Mahéga carried a rifle, and the
discharge of it was to be immediately followed by a flight of
arrows from his party, after which they were to rush on the
surprised foe, with battle&ndash;axe and tomahawk. Onward moved
the dusky band; and it seemed as if fate had given the enemy
into their power. Not a deer nor a mountain&ndash;cat was startled
from its lair to give warning of their approach; and at length
Mahéga succeeded in creeping to the bushy summit of a hillock,
whence, at a distance of less than fifty yards, he commanded
a view of the camp below.</p>

<p>“For once have the cunning and watchfulness of War&ndash;Eagle
failed him,” said the triumphant Osage to himself, as
he loosened the thong of his war&ndash;club, and thrust forward the
barrel of his rifle.</p>

<p>One by one of his followers crept forward, until they lay in
line beside him, behind the crest of the hillock, over which
their eager eyes looked down with savage anticipation upon the
Delaware camp. The moon had entirely withdrawn her light,
and all the scene was wrapt in impenetrable gloom, save where
the camp&ndash;fires cast a red glare on the bark and branches of the
surrounding trees, and on the figures which lay around, enveloped
in blanket or in bison&ndash;robe; no sound disturbed the deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
silence of the night, except the nibbling bite of the horses as
they cropped the cool grass of the valley below the camp.
For a minute Mahéga contemplated, with fierce delight, the
helpless condition of his hated foes, then taking deliberate aim
at a blanketed form supported against the tree nearest to the
fires, he pulled the fatal trigger, and without waiting to see
the effect of his shot, he shouted his battle&ndash;cry, and sprang
forward with his war&ndash;club towards the camp. Scarcely had
the bullet left his rifle ere the Crows discharged their arrows,
each aiming at the figure that he could the most easily distinguish;
then they rushed forward to complete the work of destruction
with knife and tomahawk.</p>

<p>Leaping into the camp, fifty of the savages were already in
the full glare of its fires, when a shrill whistle was heard, and
the simultaneous report of a dozen rifles echoed through mountain,
forest, and valley. So near were the marksmen, and so
true their aim, that not a bullet failed to carry a death or fatal
wound; and the surviving Crows now first ascertained that
the figures which they had been piercing were stuffed with
grass, and wrapped in blankets or robes, so as to resemble
sleeping warriors! Great was their terror and dismay; they
knew neither the number nor position of their concealed foe,
and the master&ndash;spirit who had led them, and to whose guidance
they trusted for their extrication, was nowhere to be seen.
Such had been the impetuous haste of the Osage to satisfy his
desire for vengeance, that in his rapid descent upon the enemy’s
camp he had caught his foot in a tough and tangled ground&ndash;brier,
and had fallen headlong forwards. It happened that the
very spot where he fell was the post of one of the concealed
Delawares, who grappled with him before he could rise to
continue his course.</p>

<p>Though taken thus by surprise and at disadvantage, the
fierce Osage lost not for a moment his courage or self&ndash;possession;
seizing the upraised arm of his antagonist, he wrenched
the knife from his grasp, and, swift as thought, drove it into
the heart of his foe; then tearing off the scalp, and suspending
it to his belt, he looked upon the scene of confusion and
slaughter below. A glance sufficed to show him that he had
fallen into the trap that he had prepared for others, and that a
continued contest with an enemy armed with rifles, and securely
hidden, must be attended with great and unavailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
loss. His own person had not yet come within the light of the
fires, neither had the groans of the dying Delaware been heard
amid the yells of the Crow attack, and the succeeding report
of the guns; thus was the Osage enabled to retire unobserved
a score of paces into the wood, bearing with him the yet undischarged
rifle of the Delaware whom he had slain; then he applied
his war&ndash;whistle<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> to his lips, and blew a loud and shrill
recal.</p>

<p>Glad were his faithful followers and the terrified Crows to
hear and obey the signal; yet did they not leave the scene
without further loss, for ere they got behind the circle around
which the camp&ndash;fires shed their uncertain light, another volley
was fired after them by the enemy, and although none were
killed by this second discharge, many were so grievously
wounded that they were with difficulty borne off by their
companions. It was some relief to them in their hasty retreat
to find that they were not pursued. Mahéga placed himself
in the rear; he even lingered many yards behind the rest,
crouching now and then behind tree or bush in hopes of being
able to slake his burning thirst for revenge—but in vain; War&ndash;Eagle
was too sagacious to pursue by night, in an unknown
and broken country, an enemy who, although dismayed and
panic&ndash;struck, still out&ndash;numbered his band in the proportion of
three to one.</p>

<p>“Bloody&ndash;hand, the great warrior of the Osages, will not
come again soon to visit the Lenapé camp,” said War&ndash;Eagle,
in answer to Ethelston’s congratulations, as they stood surrounded
by their victorious handful of men on the spot whence
they had just driven the enemy with so much slaughter.
“Let Attō count the dead,” continued the chief, “and bring
in the wounded, if any are found.”</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle,” said the missionary, who from his concealment
had been an unwilling spectator of the late brief, but
sanguinary skirmish, “forbear to exercise here the cruel usages
of Indian war; let the wounded be cared for, and the dead be
put to rest in peace below the earth.”</p>

<p>“The ears of War&ndash;Eagle are open to the Black Father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
words,” replied the chief sternly; “if any wounded are found,
they shall suffer no further hurt: but the scalps of the dead
shall hang on the medicine&ndash;pole of the Lenapé village, that
the spirits of Tamenund and his fathers may know that
their children have taken vengeance on the forked&ndash;tongued
Washashee.”</p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by a cry uttered by
Attō, who had found the body of the unhappy Delaware slain
by Mahéga. The whole party hastened to the spot; and
War&ndash;Eagle, without speaking a word, pointed to the reeking
skull whence the fierce Osage had torn the scalp.</p>

<p>Paul Müller, feeling that all reply would be ill&ndash;timed and
unavailing, turned away, and walked towards the feeding&ndash;place
of the horses, while the Delawares scalped and threw into an
adjacent hollow the bodies of the Crows and Osages who had
fallen. Of the latter they counted two, and of the former ten,
besides a much greater number whom they knew to have been
borne off mortally wounded.</p>

<p>As the missionary strolled onward, accompanied by Ethelston,
a low moan caught his ear, and, stooping down, he
discerned an Indian coiled up in a position indicative of intense
agony under the branches of a juniper. They carried him
back to the camp&ndash;fire, and on examining him by its light, he
proved to be a young Crow warrior, shot through the body,
who had dragged himself with difficulty for some distance,
and had then fallen exhausted to the ground. Doubtless he
expected to be immediately scalped and despatched; nor could
he for some time be induced to believe that those into whose
hands he had fallen were indeed endeavouring to alleviate his
sufferings.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle, faithful to his promise, rendered every assistance
in his power to the worthy missionary while thus employed;
but it might easily be seen, by the scornful curl of his lip, that
he looked upon this care of an enemy wounded in battle as an
absurd and effeminate practice.</p>

<p>Day broke, and the dispirited band of Crow and Osage
warriors returned from their fruitless expedition, only to find
a worse disaster at home. Great, indeed, was their dismay,
when they were met by a scout from their village, who informed
them that a party of white men had stormed the Osage camp
by night, and still retained possession of it, having destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
the greater proportion of those left to defend it. In his
description of the attack, the height, the strength, the daring and
impetuous courage of the young warrior who had led it were
painted in colours exaggerated by terror; yet the Osage chief
had no difficulty in recognising the hated rival who had struck
and disgraced him, and who was now master of the fate of her
for whose sake he had toiled, and plotted, and suffered so
much.</p>

<p>Stung to the quick by these suggestions of wounded jealousy
and pride, he ground his teeth with fury that would not be
repressed, and he swore that before two suns had risen and
set, either he or his rival, or both, should see the light of day
no more. His position was now precarious in the extreme,
all his goods and ammunition having fallen into the enemy’s
hands, excepting that which he and his few remaining followers
had about their persons. He knew that if he no longer
possessed the means of making presents, the Crows would
abandon, if not betray him at once, and he resolved to strike
some sudden and decisive blow before that thought should obtain
possession of their minds.</p>

<p>This resolve imparted again to his manner its usual fierce
and haughty grandeur; and, although the Crows loved him
not, they could not help looking with a certain awe upon the
man who, amid the confusion and panic of the late disastrous
attack upon the Delaware camp, had borne away from the
victorious enemy the bloody trophy which now hung at his
belt, and who, although he had lost by a single blow his lodges,
his supplies, and the Great Medicine of the tent, preserved
unsubdued the commanding pride of his demeanour.</p>

<p>The success of the stratagem which he now meditated will
appear in due season; meanwhile, we must return to the camp
of War&ndash;Eagle, who began his march at dawn of day, with the
view of rejoining Reginald and his band with the least possible
delay.</p>

<p>Although he did not anticipate any attempt at reprisals on
the part of the Crows, to whom he had just given so severe a
lesson, yet he was aware of Mahéga’s having escaped, and well
knew that he would leave untried no schemes for obtaining
revenge.</p>

<p>On this account the Delaware chief went forward to the
front, taking with him several of his warriors, whom he sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
out from time to time to examine the ground, and leaving
Attō with Ethelston and Paul Müller to bring up the rear.
The latter could not be prevailed upon to abandon the wounded
Crow, whom he had placed upon his own horse, which he led
by the bridle, while Ethelston supported the sufferer in the
saddle.</p>

<p>Ever since the occasion when Reginald Brandon had presented
to Attō the bear&ndash;claw collar as a testimony to his
bravery, the Delaware had attached himself more and more
to the white men; and although, with the instinctive sagacity
of his race, he foresaw that the best exertions of the two now
in his company would fail to effect a cure of the wounded
man, he willingly and good&ndash;humouredly assisted their charitable
endeavours.</p>

<p>In this order they had marched for some hours, and the
leaders of the band having attained the summit of a ridge,
already saw at no great distance the two remarkable hills before
mentioned as the favourite encampment of the Crows. Encouraged
by the sight, they descended the opposite slope with
increased speed, War&ndash;Eagle being most anxious to learn the
success of Reginald’s detachment. The whole band had passed
over the summit of the ridge, excepting the small party who
escorted the wounded Crow, when the latter grew so faint
from the effects of internal bleeding that they were no longer
able to keep him in the saddle, and deposited him gently on
the grass. The poor fellow pointed to his parched lips, and
made an imploring sign for water. Paul Müller, casting his
eyes around, saw at a small distance a broken ravine or fissure,
in which he hoped that some rain&ndash;water might be found, and
he desired Attō to hasten thither with all speed.</p>

<p>The Delaware obeyed, and had approached within a few
paces of its edge, when an arrow from an unseen enemy pierced
him through the breast; and Mahéga, leaping from his concealment,
killed the brave fellow with his club, and attached
another Lenapé scalp to his belt. He was followed by eight
or ten well&ndash;armed Crow warriors, who, passing him while he
stooped over his fallen enemy, hastened forward and surrounded
Paul Müller, Ethelston, and the wounded man. Great
was their astonishment at recognising in the latter a highly
esteemed brave of their own tribe, and greater still at observing
that the two white men were so busily engaged in tending and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
supporting him in his sufferings, as not to have noticed their
approach.</p>

<p>When Ethelston became aware of their presence, his first
impulse was to lay his hand upon a pistol in his belt; but,
with the steady self&ndash;possession of true courage, he saw at a
glance that he should, by unavailing resistance, only cause the
certain death of himself and his peaceable companion; so he
continued his attentions to the wounded man, and poured into
his mouth the last few drops of a cordial which he had reserved
in a leathern flask.</p>

<p>Fresh from the slaughter of the unfortunate Attō, Mahéga
now came forward, and would have sacrificed the unresisting
missionary to his blind fury, had not one of the Crow warriors
caught his arm, and pointed in an attitude of remonstrance to
his wounded comrade.</p>

<p>The Osage perceived at once that the time was not propitious
for his indiscriminate revenge, and contented himself
with explaining by signs to his allies that ere long the party
now out of sight behind the hill would reappear over its crest
in search of their missing companions.</p>

<p>This hint was not lost upon the Crows, who forthwith deprived
Ethelston of his arms, and, tying him with a leather
thong to the missionary, hurried them along in an oblique
direction towards an adjoining thicket, while some of them
relieved each other in the care of the dying man.</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle was already far advanced in his descent of the
hill on the opposite side, when his progress was arrested by
shouts and cries from the rear. On looking round he perceived
that these proceeded from Monsieur Perrot, who was
waving his arms, and with other gesticulations, indicative of
the greatest excitement, calling upon the chief to return.</p>

<p>“Varicle, Varicle, come quick back!”</p>

<p>Although the latter had little regard for the character of the
French valet, he saw that something alarming had occurred;
and hastening to the spot, scarcely waited to hear his explanation
that “Monsieur Etelston, de Black Fader, and de vounded
Corbeau, were not to be seen,” but pushed on at once to the
top of the hill, over which he had so lately passed.</p>

<p>Casting his anxious eyes around, he looked in vain for the
missing members of his party; but he saw at a considerable
distance on the back trail the missionary’s pony quietly cropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
the prairie&ndash;grass. Having called one of his men to his
side, and given him a few brief instructions, he returned
speedily towards the scene of the late catastrophe, and, on approaching
it, found the scalped and plundered body of Attō,
from which the Crows had carried off the arms, the belt, and
the bear&ndash;claw collar given to him by Reginald. Although
deeply grieved at the loss of the bravest of his followers, War&ndash;Eagle
was too much inured to scenes of strife and bloodshed
to give way to any emotion save the ardent desire for revenge;
and he struck off alone upon the enemy’s trail, some of his
party following him at a distance.</p>

<p>As he approached the thicket, his attention was caught by
a column of smoke ascending from a point near the centre of it;
and he judged that the band must be very strong, either in
their position or in numbers, if they could have the audacity
thus to light a camp&ndash;fire, in defiance as it were of his pursuit.
Influenced by this consideration, he waited until his whole
party had come up, when he again moved forward towards the
wood, cautiously watching every bush and shrub, in momentary
expectation of seeing the enemy start from the covert.</p>

<p>These precautions seemed, however, altogether unnecessary;
for he reached unmolested the spot whence he had seen the
smoke ascend, and on his arrival found that the fire was consuming
the last mortal remains of some human being, whose
bones were mingled with its dying embers. This he knew at
once to have been the wounded Crow who had expired in the
arms of his companions, and to whom they had paid in their
retreat this hasty funeral rite, to prevent his body from being
liable to any indignities in the event of a pursuit. The quiver
and tomahawk of the deceased warrior were suspended by a
branch over his funeral pyre, and War&ndash;Eagle turned from the
spot in moody, silent meditation. He felt assured that the
retreating party were now too far advanced for him to overtake
them, unless he gave up the idea of joining Reginald; and he
thought it by no means improbable that this attack had been
devised for the purpose of preventing that junction, so important
to the safety of both parties; wherefore he resolved to
effect it without delay, and afterwards to employ all possible
means for the recovery of the prisoners.</p>

<p>With this view he returned upon his steps; and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
seen the last honours paid to the remains of the faithful Attō,
again proceeded in the direction of the Crow camp.</p>

<p>As his little band drew near upon the prairie, it was distinctly
visible from both the fortified hills, and some fifty or
sixty horsemen galloped out from the higher of the two, with
the apparent intention of attacking him; but the steady front
presented by the white men and Delawares deterred them
from approaching too near the glittering tubes levelled to receive
them, and they galloped and wheeled in rapid circles over the
prairie, taking care, however, to keep beyond rifle range. At
this juncture the cheering notes of a bugle rose on the air;
and Reginald, who had descried his friends, now came down
with two men from his little garrison to meet them. The
Crows, seeing that further opposition on the open ground was
unavailing, retired with threats and yells to their camp; and
a few minutes afterwards the parties under War&ndash;Eagle and
Reginald were reunited within the little fortress so hardly won
by the latter, who now learnt, with unspeakable regret, the
capture of Ethelston and Paul Müller, and the death of the
brave warrior who had shared with him the perils of the first
skirmish with the Crows.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE NEGOTIATION SET ON FOOT BY REGINALD FOR THE RELEASE
OF HIS FRIENDS.—BESHA BECOMES AN IMPORTANT PERSONAGE.</p>

<p class="pn">Scarcely had War&ndash;Eagle entered within the breastwork by
the side of his friend, ere his eager and indefatigable spirit
prompted him to inspect the defences of the new camp, and to
guard every approach open to the attacks of their dangerous
neighbours. On this service Baptiste willingly agreed to
accompany the chief; and while they were thus employed,
Reginald undertook the painful task of communicating to
Prairie&ndash;bird the intelligence that her beloved instructor was,
with his friend Ethelston, a captive in the hands of the Crows.</p>

<p>Trials and sufferings of her own the maiden could bear with
fortitude; but her feelings towards the missionary were those
of the fondest daughter towards a parent; and when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
thought of the risk that be incurred of ill&ndash;usage or death at
the hands of his captors, she burst into tears, and exclaimed,
“Oh, Reginald! cannot he be rescued ere it be too late?”</p>

<p>At the sound of that voice, and the sight of those tears,
Reginald’s heart would have prompted him to rush headlong
into the camp of the Upsarokas; but he felt that he would
thereby only sacrifice his own life without effecting the object
in view; and, moreover, he was by no means certain whether
Mahéga and his party had conveyed their prisoner to the
central camp.</p>

<p>The doubt and anxiety of his mind were plainly visible on
his countenance, when a low voice whispered in his ear, “May
Wingenund speak to Netis?”</p>

<p>“Surely, dear brother,” said Reginald, laying his hand
kindly on the youth’s shoulder, “when I remember that it
was Wingenund who guided me over the prairie to his sister’s
tent, I were worse than ungrateful to reject his counsel now!”</p>

<p>“That young woman,” he replied, pointing to the captive
bride seated in the corner of the tent, “is dear to the Upsaroka
chief; she is his youngest wife, and his heart is warm towards
her. Let the one&ndash;eyed stranger from the unknown tribes, who
speaks many tongues, go back to the Crow camp, and tell the
chief that if his prisoners are hurt, his bride shall be burnt
alive; if they are set free, she shall return unhurt to his
lodge.”</p>

<p>“It is a brave device, dear Wingenund, and shall be executed
without loss of time; but can we trust the stranger?”</p>

<p>“Methinks you may,” said Prairie&ndash;bird, “for he received
his wound in defending me from those cruel men.”</p>

<p>“True,” replied Reginald; “let my brother speak to him
in the Delaware tongue, and explain the message he is to
bear.”</p>

<p>“It is well,” answered the youth; adding, with an arch
look, “and let Netis not send him away with empty hands.
There is cunning in the stranger’s eye, he knows that Mahéga
is poor; and he will rather make friends with those who have
something to give.”</p>

<p>“Be it so,” said Reginald, laughing; and he forthwith
desired one of his men to select from a package containing
knives, powder, tobacco, and cloth, a quantity equal to the
usual Indian price for a horse. Wingenund, having waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
in silence the return of the messenger, addressed the prisoner
as follows:—</p>

<p>“Has the stranger a name in his tribe?”</p>

<p>“He is called Besha in the southern prairies.”</p>

<p>“Besha dwells among the Crows. They have shed the
blood of white men and Delawares in battle; his scalp belongs
to those who have taken him.”</p>

<p>The horse&ndash;dealer bowed in silence, and the youth continued:</p>

<p>“But the heart of the white chief is great; he will not
take Besha’s life, neither will he bind his limbs. Besha is free
to go where he likes.”</p>

<p>The horse&ndash;dealer stared as if he did not quite believe his
ears; but Wingenund, without appearing to notice his surprise,
proceeded.</p>

<p>“That is not all. Besha received a wound in defending
Olitipa from the Washashee. The white chief’s hand is open;
it is quick to reward good deeds, and to punish bad ones; the
presents in that package, of knives and cloth, tobacco and
powder, are for Besha: he may return to the Upsaroka camp,
and his friends shall not say that he comes with empty hands.”</p>

<p>The deep&ndash;set eye of the horse&ndash;dealer gleamed with pleasure
as he fixed it on the welcome bale, and heard these words.
His first movement was to rise from the ground, and place the
right hands of Reginald and of Wingenund on his heart in
token of gratitude; then turning towards the latter, he inquired,
“Is there a dark cloud over the Upsaroka bride? Will
the white chief kill her, or make her a slave?”</p>

<p>“Let Besha open his ears,” replied the youth, earnestly,
“and let not the wind blow away good counsel. The Washashee
and the Upsaroka have taken captive two white men from
this band; these have killed no red man; they have done no
harm. If any hurt be done to them, or their lives be taken,
the Upsaroka bride shall be burnt before the next setting sun;
but if they are sent back free and unhurt, she shall return to
her husband the same hour, and a present four times as great
as this shall be given to Besha.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the youth placed the package in the
horse&ndash;dealer’s hands, and made him a sign to go. Before
obeying this hint, the latter whispered a few words to Bending&ndash;willow,
in which he comforted her with the assurance that he
would labour incessantly for her release; after which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
departed towards the Crow camp, with a gait somewhat
tottering and uncertain, from the joint effect of the weight of
his burthen and the wound that he had so lately received.</p>

<p>We will now leave Reginald engaged in the sad yet dear
employment of comforting his betrothed, and striving, by a
thousand suggestions, to relieve her anxiety respecting the fate
of her beloved instructor, and her lover’s friend. Neither
will we follow War&ndash;Eagle and Baptiste in securing the important
post which they had so unexpectedly won; but we
will return to the Crow camp, where Mahéga had newly
arrived with his prisoners, and where every thing was in a
state of alarm and confusion.</p>

<p>Great had been the panic consequent on the double defeat
which they had sustained; nor had its effects been entirely
removed by the successful blow last struck by Mahéga, and
the capture of the two white men. The Osage chief had lost
all his warriors, with the exception of four, his baggage and
ammunition were in the hands of the enemy, and he well
knew that his only remaining chance of retaining the support
of his allies, was in vigorously pursuing the success which he
had so opportunely gained. The Crow chief, on the other
hand, disheartened by the loss and disgrace which had befallen
his tribe, and vexed beyond measure at the detention of his
son’s favourite wife, justly attributed both these misfortunes
to an alliance which had brought no increase either to his
power or his wealth.</p>

<p>Such was the state of parties when the council of the
Upsarokas met to decide upon the fate of their prisoners. The
debate being carried on in their own language, Mahéga was
unable to gather the sentiments of the several speakers, and he
declined to sit in the circle, but stood leaning against the outer
post of the council lodge, his quick eye bent upon the countenance
of each successive speaker, as if he would read there the
purport of his harangue. One fierce and hot&ndash;headed warrior
proposed that the prisoners should be instantly put to death,
and a sudden attack be made with their whole force on the
opposite hill, which would be easily recovered, and an abundance
of plunder acquired. An older Indian next addressed
the meeting in a persuasive tone, that suited well the sharp
and cunning expression of his countenance. He argued, that
the Crows had derived no advantage, but rather loss and misfortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
from their alliance with Mahéga, and that it was their
interest to make friends with the newly arrived band, who were
more rich and powerful; wherefore he advised that the lives
of the prisoners should for the present he spared.</p>

<p>The debate was at its height, and the assembly apparently
divided in opinion, when Besha entered the council&ndash;lodge, and
sat down in the outer circle near to the entrance. All eyes
were turned to him, as the report of his capture had already
spread through the village, and his wasted appearance, as well
as the bandages over his neck and arm, showed that he had
been wounded in the late affray. After a brief silence, the
chief desired that he would relate what had occurred, a command
which the horse&ndash;dealer obeyed without hesitation.</p>

<p>Although not gifted with any orational powers, he was a
shrewd fellow, thoroughly versed in all the wiles of Indian
diplomacy, and well aware, as a resident guest among the
Crows, that his best chance of a favourable hearing was to
frame his speech according to their interests, which happened
in the present instance to tally with his own. In relating the
events which had occurred in the opposite camp, he exaggerated
the strength and wealth of the enemy, dwelling at large upon
the clemency shown to himself, and upon the desire evinced
for peace; stating, in conclusion, that he was the bearer of a
specific message, or proposal, to the great chief. At this
announcement there was a general murmur of curiosity, and
Mahéga bit his lip with vexation at his inability to understand
what was going on.</p>

<p>At a signal from the chief, Besha proceeded to inform the
council, that Bending&ndash;willow, the bride of their favourite and
absent war&ndash;leader, was now a captive; and he recounted faithfully
the circumstances under which she had visited the white
tent with him, and the terrible threats held out respecting her
in the event of any injury being done to the white prisoners.
The effect of this announcement was so great, that it was
visible even to Mahéga; nor was he surprised when Besha
explained to him, by order of the chief, that the council had
decided upon sparing the lives of the white men, at least until
the return of the war&ndash;leader and his band of braves, now absent
on a foray into the country of the Black&ndash;feet.</p>

<p>Agreeably to this decision, Paul Müller and Ethelston were
confined in a lodge adjoining that of the chief, under a Crow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
guard, to whom strict orders were given to prevent their escape,
and also to protect them against any attempt on the part
of Mahéga or his followers. Besha was allowed to see them,
and they learnt from him that their friends had been completely
successful, and had recaptured the Great Medicine of the
tent, as well as the ammunition and baggage. He further
informed them, that he would do all in his power to effect
their release; adding a significant hint that he should not be
unwilling to receive tangible proofs of their gratitude.</p>

<p>The captives were, upon the whole, much comforted by
this interview; and on his departure, Ethelston said, addressing
his companion, “Reverend father, we have cause to be
grateful for the intelligence communicated to us by this man,
inasmuch as we expected no less than to be put to an immediate
and perhaps a cruel death. Yet, methinks, for a messenger
of good tidings, he has the most uncomely and villanous
countenance that ever I beheld.”</p>

<p>“I will not say that his face recommends him,” said Paul
Müller, smiling; “albeit the expression thereof may have
been altered for the worse by the loss of an eye. I have seen
him more than once before among the tribes bordering upon
the Mexican frontier, and if my memory serves me, he bore
the reputation of being a crafty and designing knave in his
vocation; but I never heard him charged with cruelty or thirst
of blood.”</p>

<p>“What, then, do you think are the motives for the friendly
exertions which he professes to make in our behalf?”</p>

<p>“We will hope that they are partly owing to a grateful
sense of the treatment he has experienced at the hands of our
friend Reginald, and partly from the expectation of presents
and rewards, which the Osage is no longer in a condition to
offer. Meanwhile, we must solace ourselves in our captivity with
the reflection, that my beloved pupil is safe under the charge
of friends upon whose fidelity and devotion we can fully rely.”</p>

<p>Leaving the captives to comfort each other with these and
other similar suggestions, we will return to Reginald Brandon,
who forgot not, even in the enjoyment of Prairie&ndash;bird’s society,
to occupy himself constantly in devising plans for their liberation.
In these he was warmly seconded by War&ndash;Eagle and
Baptiste; but, after carefully reconnoitring the Crow camp,
they agreed that it was too strong to be carried by open attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
by their small party, especially as they had learnt from Besha
that the husband of Bending&ndash;willow, the son of the great
chief, had just returned with his band, consisting of fifty
chosen warriors, from a successful foray into the Black&ndash;foot
country.</p>

<p>The wily horse&ndash;dealer was allowed, in his mixed capacity of
interpreter and envoy, to pass from camp to camp; and, as
both parties were desirous of securing his co&ndash;operation, presents
were liberally heaped upon him; and his grey eye twinkled, as
he cast it upon the increasing pile of goods at the back of his
lodge. “There will soon be enough to exchange for a hundred
beaver&ndash;skins,” said he to himself; “then Besha will look
for some fine horses, and go towards the east.”</p>

<p>While he was thus congratulating himself on his prospects
of future wealth, a tall figure darkened the entrance of his
lodge, and the young war&ndash;chief stood before him. “<i>White&ndash;bull</i><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
would speak with Besha,” said the former in a haughty
tone, adjusting with dignity the cream&ndash;coloured robe from
which he took his designation.</p>

<p>“Let the young chief be seated,” replied the horse&ndash;dealer,
making at the same time a signal to one of his lads to offer
food and a pipe to his guest.</p>

<p>White&ndash;Bull’s first impulse was to refuse this hospitality,
but he checked it; and having tasted a morsel, and emitted two
voluminous puffs of smoke from the pipe, he turned to the
horse&ndash;dealer, and said in a stern deep tone, “Bending&ndash;willow
is a prisoner in the white tent! Besha took her there, he
must bring her back, for the heart of White&ndash;bull is dark—there
is no light or pleasure without her.”</p>

<p>“The will of the bride was strong,” he replied; “she
would take no counsel from Besha; if he did not go with her
she would go alone to consult the Medicine of the tent; Besha
went with her that none might do her harm.”</p>

<p>“The ears of White&ndash;bull are not to be tickled by the songs
of birds,” said the young chief, fiercely. “Besha took her to
the white men’s camp, and he must bring her back before two
suns have set, or his heart shall be cut out from his body.”</p>

<p>“White&ndash;bull knows that there are two white prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
here; let him give them to Besha, and he will bring back
Bending&ndash;willow before the sun is in the west.”</p>

<p>“The white prisoners belong to the war&ndash;council,” said the
young man sullenly. “White&ndash;bull cares not whether they
live or die; but he wants his bride, whom the fool Besha led
away to a place where she was caught like a beaver in a trap;
if he does not bring her back within two sunsets, the blade of
this knife shall be red. White&ndash;bull has spoken, and his words
are not wind!” So saying, the violent youth passed with
angry strides from the horse&ndash;dealer’s lodge.</p>

<p>Besha now found himself in an awkward predicament, in
endeavouring to extricate himself from which his first step
was to consult the young chief’s father, hoping that the latter
would give his consent at once to release the prisoners for the
recovery of the favourite bride. But the old man would not
agree to the proposal, giving as his reason, that the council
had resolved either to take the lives of the prisoners, or to
make the enemy pay many horses and much goods for their
ransom. “Besha has a tongue,” continued the crafty old
man; “he can speak with the white men; he can tell them
that if the bride is given up, their friends shall be returned;
they will believe him, and all will be well.”</p>

<p>Besha, though not particularly scrupulous in his morality,
was startled at first by this proposal of treacherous and deliberate
falsehood towards one who had spared his life and had
given him his liberty, besides loading him with presents; but
his conscience being of an extremely elastic texture, he soon
reconciled himself to the idea by the reflection that it was his
best, if not his only chance of saving his life from the fury of
the incensed White&ndash;bull. He made no reply to the old chief;
but, as he went away, the two rogues exchanged a look which
satisfied them that they understood each other.</p>

<p>The horse&ndash;dealer proceeded without delay to the lodge where
Paul Müller and Ethelston were confined, into which he was
admitted by their guards. Having explained to the missionary
that he was about to visit the white men’s camp for the purpose
of liberating him and his companion by the recovery of the captive
bride, he desired to be furnished with a sign by which
they would be induced to give her up without hesitation; for
Besha, in his rambles on the Mexican frontier, had frequently
met with the Spanish traders, and although he could not read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
letters himself, he knew how they were used for the interchange
of communication at a distance.</p>

<p>Before giving any reply, Paul Müller explained the state of
affairs to his companion, and asked his counsel.</p>

<p>“Methinks we should trust the fellow,” said Ethelston,
“for he has hitherto befriended us: but let us not write any
thing that can endanger the safety of Prairie&ndash;bird.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, my son,” he replied, “and will write
accordingly.”</p>

<p>So saying, he took a small pocket&ndash;book from his breast, and
wrote with a pencil upon a leaf of it the following words:</p>

<p>“Ethelston and Paul Müller send their affectionate greeting.
The bearer says that he can liberate them if the captive
bride is restored. Reginald Brandon will consult with those
about him, and do what he thinks best. Let the safety of
Prairie&ndash;bird, and of those who are now her protectors, be the
first object. Glad and thankful should we be to embrace our
dear friends again; but we are well and cheerful here: in joy
and in sorrow, in life and in death, we are in the hands of
One who rules all for the best. Farewell.”</p>

<p>Having received the paper, Besha lost no time in setting off
to the opposite camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">DAVID MUIR AND HIS DAUGHTER PAY A VISIT TO COLONEL BRANDON.—THE
MERCHANT BECOMES AMBITIOUS; HE ENTERTAINS
PROJECTS FOR JESSIE’S FUTURE WELFARE, WHICH DO NOT
COINCIDE WITH THAT YOUNG LADY’S WISHES.</p>

<p class="pn">While the events related in the preceding chapters were
passing in the great Western wilderness, the days of early
summer glided smoothly on at Mooshanne, uninterrupted by
any incident worthy of record. Aunt Mary continued her
round of busy occupation with her usual indefatigable activity.
Never could there occur in the neighbourhood a case of sickness
or of sorrow to which she did not hasten to administer
the needful consolation; and in the town of Marietta her
benevolent exertions were assisted by Jessie Muir, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
attendance in her father’s store enabled her to gather all the
current news from the numerous customers who frequented it.</p>

<p>“The merchant” (for so David Muir was designated by all
who did not wish to affront him) grew daily in importance
and dignity. His speculations in trade had been, for the most
part, successful; and two or three of his suggestions for the
improvement of the town had been adopted. A sharp attack
of fever had subdued for a season the domineering spirit of
Dame Christie; and David found himself not only respected
by the neighbours, but even enjoyed the sweet though brief
delusion, that he was master in his own house.</p>

<p>Neither his pride nor his increasing wealth interrupted,
however, his close attention to business; and Colonel Brandon,
finding that the affairs entrusted to him were managed with
great punctuality and skill, treated him with corresponding
confidence.</p>

<p>On a fine summer’s morning, about a month after Ethelston’s
departure for the Far&ndash;west, the merchant’s four&ndash;wheeled
chaise stood before his door, drawn, not by a sorry
pony, but by a strong horse, the condition and appearance of
which betokened the thriving circumstances of the owner.
Jessie Muir, wearing a very becoming bonnet, and a shawl
newly arrived from England, had just cast a passing look into
the oval mirror in the back&ndash;parlour, and was busily employed
in giving directions respecting the contents of a parcel about
to be placed in the seat of the chaise, while Henry Gregson
was listening with ill&ndash;dissembled impatience to the repeated
cautions given to him by David as to his conduct during the
brief absence which he meditated.</p>

<p>“Noo, Hairy,” (for thus was the name of Harry pronounced
in David’s north&ndash;country dialect,) “ye maun be vera
carefu’ o’ the store, and see that the lads attend weel to the
folk wha come to buy, and that Jane stays aye amang the caps
an’ shawls and printed cottons, instead of keekin out o’ the
window at a wheen idle ne’er&ndash;do&ndash;weels in the street; and as
for the last lot of Bohea, ye can truly say it’s the finest that
ever cam’ to Marietta: I’m thinkin’ the minister’s wife will
be fain to buy a pun’ or twa. And, Hairy, mind that ye ...
but the deil’s in the lad! what are ye glow’ring at, over my
shoulder, as if ye se’ed a wraith, an’ no listening to what
I’m sayin’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the merchant turned round, and his eye happening to
fall upon a parcel of fire&ndash;irons so carelessly placed on an upper
shelf, that they threatened the destruction of a pile of crockery
below, he ordered the shop&ndash;boy to secure the offending tongs,
and, turning to Harry, continued in a more complacent tone,
“It’s nae wonder, lad, that ye could na tak’ your een off they
irons; they had like to make an awfu’ smash amaing the cups
and saucers; I’m glad to see that ye ‘re so canny and carefu’
o’ the goods.”</p>

<p>Harry bit his lips, and made no reply, while the merchant,
who had already seen Jessie take her seat in the chaise, was
preparing to follow, when he turned to the young man, and
said in a low voice, “Ye ‘ll not forget that the mistress will
need her gruel at midday?”</p>

<p>“I will take care that it is not forgotten, and I suppose,
sir, the glass of French brandy is to be put into it?”</p>

<p>“Glass o’ French brandy, ya daft chiel,” said the merchant,
forgetting for a moment the prudential whisper; then resuming
it, he added, “Wha talks o’ glasses o’ French brandy?
Ye ken tho’ that the mistress has no gotten her strength yet,
and she said she would like just four spoonfu’s o’ brandy in
the gruel to gie’t a taste and keep the cauld out o’ her wame.
Ye ken the mistress’ ain spoon in the tea&ndash;cup&ndash;board?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I know it well,” replied Harry, with demure
gravity, adding, half&ndash;aloud, as his principal drove from the
door, “and a precious gravy&ndash;spoon it is; before it is four
times filled and emptied it will make the largest wine&ndash;glass in
the store run over the brim, and the old lady’s tongue go like
a mill&ndash;wheel. Never mind, for Jessie’s sake, I’ll brew the
gruel as stiff as my father’s grog, and bear Dame Christie’s
scolds without complaint.”</p>

<p>“He’s a canny, douce lad, yon Hairy,” said the merchant
to his daughter, as they jolted leisurely along the uneven, but
picturesque road that led from Marietta to Mooshanne, “and
does na’ care to rin about the toon like ither idle gillies, but
seems aye content to min’ the store; did ye see, Jessie, how
he caught wi’ ae blink o’ his ee the airns that were about to
fa’ amongst my best Wedgewood?”</p>

<p>Had the merchant not been occupied as he put this question,
in guiding the wheels between sundry deep ruts and holes
in the road, he could not have failed to observe the heightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
colour that it brought into Jessie’s countenance; for the maiden
was conscious that at the moment referred to, Harry’s gaze
had been fixed, not upon the fire&ndash;irons or the Wedgewood,
but upon her own comely self.</p>

<p>It is one of the peculiar properties and triumphs of love,
that, not content with securing its own position in the human
heart, it delights in unsettling and metamorphosing the tenants
by which it was previously occupied. Under its wayward
sway boldness becomes timidity, and fierceness is transformed
into gentleness, while bashfulness is rendered bold, and simplicity
has recourse to the devices of cunning.</p>

<p>Thus Jessie Muir, who was naturally of a frank open disposition,
but who had a secret presentiment that her father
would reject the suit of her lover if it were now to be declared,
acquiesced demurely in his observation respecting the
attention shown by Harry Gregson to the business of the
store.</p>

<p>“Weel, a&ndash;weel,” continued the merchant, “he’s a gude
lad, and no ill&ndash;faured neither; I’m thinkin’, Jessie, that he
and Jean will maybe fancy each other; they’re aye thegither
i’ the store, an’ the bit lassie might gae further and fare waur
than by takin’ up wi’ Hairy.”</p>

<p>This speech was too much for Jessie’s equanimity; the
coolness with which her father spoke of his servant&ndash;maid
“takin’ up” with her lover, stung her to the quick, and she
replied tartly, “Father, I wish you would mind your driving
among these holes and stumps, instead of talking about Jean
and her idle nonsense. Indeed, father, that last jolt nearly
threw me out of the chaise.”</p>

<p>“Weel, Jessie, ye need na mak’ such a pother about a
stump mair or less atween Marietta and Mooshanne; and
though I’ll no say that my drivin’ is like that of Jehu, the
son of Jehoshaphat, ye need na fear that I’ll coup the braw
new chaise for a’ that.”</p>

<p>Jessie was well pleased to have turned her father’s thoughts
into another channel; and being a little ashamed of the momentary
irritation to which she had given way, she now
exerted herself to please and amuse him, in which she succeeded
so well that they reached Mooshanne in cheerful mood,
and with wheels uninjured by hole or stump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Brandon, seeing the merchant drive up to the door
just as he, with Lucy and Aunt Mary, were about to sit down
to dinner, went himself to the door, and, with the frank hospitality
of his nature, invited him and his daughter to share
their family meal. This invitation was no small gratification
to the pride of David Muir, who had on former visits to Mooshanne
regaled himself with Monsieur Perrot in the pantry.
The boxes and parcels having been safely deposited, and the
chaise sent round to the stable, Lucy aided Jessie to uncloak
and unbonnet, and in a few minutes the party, thus increased,
found themselves assembled at the Colonel’s table.</p>

<p>“My worthy friend,” said the latter, addressing his guest,
“you seem to have brought an unusual variety of packages to&ndash;day;
I suppose the greater part of them are for Lucy’s benefit
rather than for mine?”</p>

<p>“Maybe Jessie has brought a few things fresh frae Philadelphy
for Miss Lucy to look at,” replied David; “but the
maist part o’ what I hae wi’ me the day, came late yestreen,
by Rob Mitchell’s batteau from St. Louis. There’s a wheen
letters and parcels frae Messieurs Steiner and Roche, which
will, nae doubt, explain the settlement o’ the matter anent your
shares in the fur trade.”</p>

<p>“Are there not any other letters from Saint Louis?”
inquired Lucy, colouring slightly.</p>

<p>“There’s nane, my bonny young leddy,” replied David,
“excepting twa, ane frae auld Miller, to acknowledge the
receipt o’ the last ten barrels o’ saut pork that I sent him, and
anither frae Reuben Stiggs, wha keeps the great outfitting store
for trappers, to order an early freight o’ blankets, bibles, religious
tracts, scalp&ndash;knifes, and whisky, for the Indian trade.”</p>

<p>In spite of her disappointment, Lucy could not forbear
smiling at the gravity with which the merchant enumerated
this strange mixture of goods ordered for a warehouse, to
which the missionary and the trapper both resorted for
their respective supplies.</p>

<p>The dinner passed agreeably enough; and Jessie Muir
having soon recovered from the diffident shyness by which
she had been at first overcome, amused Lucy and Aunt
Mary by her quiet, but shrewd, observations on persons and
things in Marietta; while the merchant enjoyed, with evident
satisfaction, several glasses from a certain bottle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
madeira, which he knew to have been for some years deposited
in his own warehouse.</p>

<p>As soon as dinner was over, the ladies retired to Lucy’s
boudoir, where she examined the contents of the packages
which Jessie had brought for her inspection, while Colonel
Brandon looked over the letters and papers from St. Louis.
These proved to be of considerable importance, as they announced
that all the points in dispute with the other fur
company had been satisfactorily arranged, and that his own
shares, as well as those in which Ethelston’s property was
chiefly invested, had risen greatly in value. During the
perusal of this correspondence the Colonel spoke from time
to time familiarly and unreservedly with his companion.
He had learnt from Lucy the attachment that existed between
Henry Gregson and the merchant’s daughter, and
had formed an internal resolution to contribute to its successful
issue by advancing to the young man a sum sufficient
to enable him either to enter into partnership with
the merchant, or to commence business on his own account;
but it was not his intention to develope this scheme until
he had spoken with the elder Gregson; wherefore, he contented
himself for the present with sounding the merchant
in vague and general terms respecting the disposal of his
daughter’s hand.</p>

<p>“My good friend,” said the Colonel, “now that we have
despatched our business, it occurs to me that I ought to
remind you of a circumstance which may not yet have entered
your thoughts, namely, that your daughter Jessie is
grown up to be a very pretty, sensible, and discreet young
woman, and that having no son of your own, you ought
to seek for her a worthy husband, who might hereafter aid
her in comforting the declining years of Dame Christie
and yourself.”</p>

<p>During this address the merchant fidgeted on his chair,
and betrayed other evident symptoms of uneasiness; but he
made no reply, and the Colonel continued: “I think I
know of a young man who has long entertained an attachment
for her; and, if I am not mistaken, Miss Jessie would
be more likely to smile than to frown upon his suit. Feeling
myself not a little interested in his future prospects, I
should, if Mrs. Muir and yourself approve the match, willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
contribute, as far as lies in my power, to their comfortable
settlement.”</p>

<p>“Really, Colonel Brandon, ye’re vera kind, I can no’ fin’
words to thank ye,” stammered David, who seemed to have
lost his self&ndash;possession; and before he could recover it so
far as to make any distinct reply, Lucy came into the room;
and taking the Colonel’s arm, looked up affectionately into
his face, saying, “Dear father, you have given enough time
now to business; come into my room and hear one of Jessie’s
Scotch songs. I have just been listening to one which was
written, as she tells me, by Robert Burns; it is so simple and
so beautiful, she has promised to sing it over again for you.”</p>

<p>The Colonel smiled, and followed his daughter, saying to the
merchant as they left the room, “We will speak further on
that subject the next time that we meet.”</p>

<p>As soon as the little party was assembled in the boudoir,
Colonel Brandon entreated Jessie Muir to fulfil her promise of
singing again the song which had given so much pleasure to
his daughter. Blushing slightly, Jessie complied, and sung,
in a voice of much natural sweetness, and without accompaniment:—</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Oh! wert thou in the cauld, cauld blast,<br />
On yonder lea, on yonder lea;</p>
<p class="pph6">My plaidie to the angry <i>airt</i>,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a><br />
I’d shelter thee, I’d shelter thee.</p>
<p class="pph6">Or did misfortune’s bitter storms<br />
Around thee blaw, around thee blaw;</p>
<p class="pph6">Thy <i>bield</i><a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> should be my bosom,<br />
To share it a’, to share it a’.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Or were I in the wildest waste,<br />
Sae black an’ bare, sae black and bare;</p>
<p class="pph6">The desert were a paradise,<br />
If thou wert there, if thou wert there:</p>
<p class="pph6">Or were I monarch of the globe,<br />
Wi’ thee to reign, wi’ thee to reign;</p>
<p class="pph6">The brightest jewel in my crown<br />
Should be my queen, should be my queen.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Colonel having bestowed not undeserved praise upon the
taste and feeling with which Jessie had sung her simple melody,
added, “Yet I do not remember these words among the
songs of the Ayrshire bard. Lucy, you have often read to me
from the volume of his poems which came from England; do
you recollect having seen this song amongst them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed I do not,” replied Lucy; “yet it is so full of
his peculiar force of expression and feeling, that it is difficult
to believe it to have been written by any one else.”</p>

<p>“I have been told,” said Jessie, “that this song was found
among his papers after his death. This may be the reason
why you have not seen it in your volume.”</p>

<p>The conversation having once turned upon the subject of the
writings of Ayrshire’s immortal bard, whose fame was then
spreading far and wide over the habitable globe, it dwelt for some
time upon the attractive theme; and the tall pines were already
beginning to cast their lengthened shadows over the lawn, ere
the merchant remembered that Dame Christie might be
“wearyin’” for his return, and perhaps scold him for exposing
himself and his daughter to the perils of the Mooshanne
stump&ndash;studded track in the dusk of the evening. The chaise
having been ordered to the door, David Muir put on his hat
and cloak, while Jessie donned her bonnet and shawl; and a
few minutes saw them jogging steadily away on their return to
Marietta.</p>

<p>For some time, neither broke the silence of the deep forest
through which they were driving, for each had their own
subject for meditation. Jessie, whose spirit was softened by
the songs of her father&ndash;land, and had been touched by the
gentle kindness of Lucy’s manner towards her, looked steadily
towards the west; and while she thought that she was
admiring the gigantic hemlock pines, whose huge limbs now
came out in bold relief from the ruddy saffron sky beyond,
her musings blended in sweet, but vague, confusion the banks
of Allan, Doon, and Ayr, with those of the river beside her,
and pictured the “Jamies,” “Willies,” and other “braw,
braw lads” of Scottish minstrelsy, in the form of no less a personage
than Harry Gregson.</p>

<p>She was roused from her reverie by the voice of her father,
whose meditations had taken quite a different direction, as
will be seen by the conversation that ensued between them.</p>

<p>“Jessie, it’s a gae bonnie house, yon Mooshanne, an’ the
mailen’s<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> the best in th’ haill territory.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, father, it is a very pretty house, and most kind
are those who live in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wad ye no’ like to live in it yoursel, Jessie?”</p>

<p>“To say truth, father, I would rather live in a smaller
house that I might call my own.”</p>

<p>“But suppose ye might ca’ yon fine house your own, what
wad ye say then, lassie?” This inquiry was enforced with a
significant poke from the merchant’s elbow.</p>

<p>Jessie looked up in her father’s face, and seeing that it
was unusually grave, she replied, “Father, I do not understand
what you are aiming at. I am very happy in our
house at Marietta, and wish for none better.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re a fule,” said the merchant, angrily. “I tell ye,
Jessie, ye’re no better than a fule; and when fortun’ hands
oot her han’ to ye, ye’ll no’ gang half&ndash;way to tak’ it. Hae ye
no’ seen how oft Maister Reginald comes to our store, and
hangs aboot it like a tod round a hen&ndash;roost?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, father, I have made no such remark; and if
Master Reginald did often come to our store, it was for powder,
or a knife, or some trifle for Miss Lucy, and not for any
other cause.”</p>

<p>“Hoot awa’ wi’ your pouther and knives, ye blind hizzie,”
said the merchant; “it was to see and speak wi’ yoursel”, and
no’ for any other cause.”</p>

<p>“Father, I am sure you are mistaken; Master Reginald
would never so far forget the difference in our rank and
condition, and I should be very sorry if he did.”</p>

<p>“What do ye mean, lass, about difference o’ rank and
condeetion? Are the Muirs no’ as weel&ndash;born as ony lord or
duke in the auld kintra? Do ye no’ ken that my mother’s
father’s sister was married to Muir of Drumliwhappit, an’
that he was near cousin to the Laird o’ Blagowrie, wha
married the sister o’ the Earl o’ Glencairn? Rank and condeetion,
indeed! as I tauld ye, just now, ye’re neither mair
nor less than a fule, Jessie. Why, the Colonel spak’ wi’ me
anent the matter this vera day, an’ said that he’d do what lay
in his power to mak a’ smooth an’ comfortable.”</p>

<p>Jessie Muir was now, indeed, surprised; for she had
hitherto imagined that the idea of Reginald Brandon having
taken a fancy to her, was one of those crotchets which the
merchant sometimes took up, and which he would then maintain
with all the pertinacious obstinacy of his character; but
she knew him to be incapable of a direct untruth, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
therefore overwhelmed with astonishment at the communication
last made to her.</p>

<p>We should not faithfully portray Jessie’s character, were we
to say that she experienced no secret gratification when she
learnt that her hand was sought by one possessed of so many
advantages of person and fortune; but we should do her
injustice were we not to add, that the sensation endured only
for a moment; and then, her heart reverting to Henry Gregson,
she thought only of the increased obstacles which would
now interfere with their attachment, and she burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Dinna greet, lassie, dinna greet,”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> said the merchant,
surprised and somewhat softened by this unexpected emotion,
and he muttered to himself, “There’s no kenning the twists
and krankums o’ a woman’s mind! I tell her that she’s
courted by a weel&ndash;faured young man, wi’ the best prospects in
the haill territory, and she taks on to greet like a <i>skelpit
wean</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>After various ineffectual attempts to draw from her any
explanation of the cause of her grief, he ceased to interrogate
her, wisely resolving to consult Dame Christie on the subject,
and they drove on in silence until they reached their home in
Marietta.</p>

<p>As they entered the house they were met by Harry Gregson,
who led the way into the parlour, where he placed in the
merchant’s hand a paper which had arrived during his absence,
and which proved to be an extensive order for articles to be
shipped for St. Louis on the following day.</p>

<p>Whilst David Muir ran his eye over the list, calculating
the amount of profit which he might expect to realise from
the whole, young Gregson, observing the tears not yet dry
upon Jessie’s cheek, cast upon her a look of anxious affectionate
inquiry, which seemed only to increase her confusion
and distress.</p>

<p>“Father, I am tired,” she whispered, in a subdued voice,
“and will go to my room to rest.” Having received his embrace,
she turned towards the door, where Gregson presented
to her a candle that he had lighted for her, and in so doing he
took her hand and pressed it; she withdrew it gently, and, in
reply to his “Good night, Miss Jessie,” gave him in silence a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
parting look so full of mingled tenderness and grief, that his
anxiety was no longer to be controlled, and he resolved to draw
from the merchant some explanation of her agitation. Seeing
that he had at length finished his careful perusal of the paper,
he said, “I think, sir, that Miss Jessie looks very unwell this
evening; has any thing happened to hurt or alarm her?”</p>

<p>“Naething, naething, my gude lad, only I tauld her some
news that ought to have made her blithe as a lavrock,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and
she thought fit to wet her een wi’ dool<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> anent it.”</p>

<p>“That is strange, indeed,” replied the young man; and he
added, in a hesitating tone, “I hope, sir, you will not think
me impertinent, as I take so much interest in all that concerns
your family, if I inquire what was the nature of the good
news that you communicated to Miss Jessie?”</p>

<p>“Why, Hairy,” replied the merchant, sinking his voice to
a confidential whisper, “as ye’re a discreet cannie lad, that’ll
no crack<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> about they things all ower the toon, I may just tell
ye that, Jessie—“</p>

<p>“David! David!” screamed a shrill voice from the room
above, “are ye gaun to haver<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> there the lee&ndash;lang night?”</p>

<p>“Comin’ this moment, Christie,” said the obedient husband,
leaving the room as he spoke, with the air and countenance
of one so thoroughly hen&ndash;pecked, that Harry Gregson,
in spite of his anxiety, laughed outright; saying to himself,
as many a lover has said before and since, “How unlike is
Jessie’s voice to that of her mother!”</p>

<p class="pch">BESHA PURSUES HIS CAREER AS A DIPLOMATIST.—AN AGREEABLE
TETE&ndash;A&ndash;TETE DISAGREEABLY INTERRUPTED.—THE STEPS THAT
MAHÉGA TOOK TO SUPPORT HIS DECLINING INTERESTS AMONG
THE CROWS.</p>

<p class="pn">We left Besha engaged in an attempt to liberate the bride of
the young Crow chief, by proposing to Reginald and his party
an exchange of prisoners.</p>

<p>On arriving at the camp, he was allowed to pass by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
sentries, and took his way up the hill to the tent of Prairie&ndash;bird.
As soon as the object of his errand became known, a
council was held, consisting of Reginald Brandon, War&ndash;Eagle,
Baptiste, Pierre, and Wingenund; and, having heard the
proposal made on the part of the Crows they proceeded to
deliberate on the course to be pursued.</p>

<p>They could have no hesitation in agreeing to an exchange
of prisoners, could that be effected upon equal terms; but the
Crows insisted upon the return of Bending&ndash;willow, as a preliminary
step towards the release of their prisoners, and to
this Baptiste and Pierre were most strongly opposed, especially
the latter, who had experienced on more than one occasion
the proverbial treachery of the Upsaroka tribe.</p>

<p>Reginald was disposed, with the fearless generosity of his
nature, to be satisfied with binding them, by the most solemn
obligations recognised by their customs, to release their prisoners
on the safe return of Bending&ndash;willow; but his opinion
was overruled by his companions, and the horse&ndash;dealer’s
mission wore a most unpromising aspect, when he bethought
him of delivering the note written by Paul Müller to Reginald.</p>

<p>The perusal of this effected an immediate alteration in the
sentiments of the council, and the restoration of the captive
bride was decided upon. She was seated in the outer compartment
of Prairie&ndash;bird’s tent, when Besha entered, accompanied
by Reginald, to inform her of her liberation.</p>

<p>Pierre, who was still suspicious of some treachery, and who
had some knowledge of the Crow language, placed his ear at
the corner of the aperture, with the intention of discovering
any under&ndash;plot that might be going forward.</p>

<p>Besha, however, was too crafty to be caught in such a trap,
or else he did not intend to make Bending&ndash;willow the confidant
of his real intentions; so he simply announced to her
that she was free to return to her husband’s lodge, and that
the white prisoners were to be restored in exchange for her.</p>

<p>Shaking off the sadness by which she had been of late overcome,
she sprang to her feet, and her eyes sparkling with
grateful joy, she pressed her hand upon Reginald’s breast,
then, looking round, she pronounced distinctly the name of
“Olitipa.”</p>

<p>On hearing herself thus called, Prairie&ndash;bird came forth from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
her inner tent, and having learnt the intelligence that, by the
restoration of her new friend, the liberation of Paul Müller
was to be effected, she embraced the former and presented her
with a necklace of coral. Bending&ndash;willow returned the embrace
with affectionate earnestness, and was then led by Besha
from the tent.</p>

<p>As they passed towards the stockade, Pierre, whose suspicions
were not yet entirely lulled, and who felt a deep interest
in the safety of Ethelston, came up to the horse&ndash;dealer, and
whispered in his ear, “If the tongues of the Crows or of
Besha are forked, if the white prisoners are detained or injured,
many widows shall howl in the camp, and the tongues
of the wolves shall be red with Upsaroka blood!”</p>

<p>The prairie&ndash;guide spoke these words in a tone of deep meaning,
and Besha knew that he was not a man likely to utter an
idle or empty threat; he answered accordingly, “If Besha
lives, the prisoners shall return unhurt before the next sunset,”
and, so saying, pursued his unmolested way to the Crow
camp.</p>

<p>While they were crossing the valley which separated the
two encampments, Reginald, War&ndash;Eagle, and Baptiste still
lingered near the door of the tent, discussing the events of the
day, and expressing their respective opinions as to the probable
conduct of the Crows.</p>

<p>“What says Prairie&ndash;bird?” inquired Reginald, addressing
the maiden, who had been a not uninterested auditor of the
discussion.</p>

<p>“Has not the Crow chief,” she replied, “given a faithful
promise that on the return of the bride he would restore my
father and his friend unhurt?”</p>

<p>“He has.”</p>

<p>“What, then, is the doubt?”</p>

<p>“The doubt is, whether the word of the Crow can be
believed: whether he may not still detain or injure his
prisoners.”</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird mused for a few seconds, as if debating within
herself the possibility of such falsehood; then raising her head,
she said in a tone of emphasis, “Fear not: my father and
your friend will return to us uninjured.”</p>

<p>“I accept the omen, sweet prophetess!” exclaimed Reginald,
cheerfully; “and will believe that their thoughts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
honest and straightforward, as you deem them, unless their
conduct should prove the contrary; in that event,” he added,
turning to War&ndash;Eagle, “my Indian brother and I will see
what our own heads and hands can do to set free our friends.”</p>

<p>The chief replied not; but the sarcastic smile that played
over his dark features, showed how little he shared in Prairie&ndash;bird’s
opinion of Upsaroka faith.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bending&ndash;willow returned in safety to her lodge,
where Besha presented her, with an air of triumph, to her
impatient lord. The other wives and women retired while she
related to him her adventures; and from the mingled laughter
and caresses with which he listened to her narrative, it is probable
that she confessed to him the motive that had induced
her to seek the Medicine of the white tent.</p>

<p>As soon as she concluded, he desired one of his young men
to lead before the lodge a favourite horse, swift, high&ndash;couraged,
and strong, from the back of which he had killed, with lance
and bow, many a bison cow. Placing the bridle of raw hide
in the hands of the horse&ndash;dealer, he said, “Besha has brought
back the Sweet&ndash;scented&ndash;willow to its bed, he shall not go away
with empty hands. When he rides through the village the
warriors shall say that his horse is fit to carry a chief; and if
any speak to him bad words, let him tell them to beware, for
White&ndash;bull calls him brother!”</p>

<p>So saying, the young savage, who had now completely recovered
his good humour, half&ndash;lifted, half&ndash;threw the astonished
dealer upon the horse’s back, and turned again into the lodge
to renew his caresses to his recovered bride.</p>

<p>“All goes well!” thought Besha within himself, as he
rode towards his own quarters, proving, with professional skill,
the paces and qualities of his new steed. “All goes well!
and this animal will fetch me two hundred dollars in the lower
Arkansas country; few such are to be found there. I wonder
where this Crow thief found or stole it? If I can manage
with fine words to get a few more skins from this tribe, and a
few more presents from the white men, I will join the summer
return&ndash;train from the Black Hills, and make my way back
towards the east.”</p>

<p>Indulging in these honest and disinterested meditations, the
horse&ndash;dealer arrived before his own lodge, where his Indian
wife awaited his coming with a savoury mess of bison&ndash;meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
and marrow; after despatching which he smoked his pipe,
without permitting any reflections concerning the prisoners
whose cause he had so shamelessly betrayed to disturb his
appetite or his present lazy enjoyment.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for them that they had an advocate more
honest and zealous in a quarter where they least suspected it.
This was Bending&ndash;willow; who, after showing to her lover&ndash;husband
the coral necklace given to her by Prairie&ndash;bird, and
repeating to him the kind treatment that she had experienced
in the tent, entreated him to use his influence for the restoration
of the prisoners.</p>

<p>This she was not able to effect, as he stated that they
belonged to the great council, who would decide upon their
fate, after consulting the Medicine; but she obtained from him
a promise that he would in the meantime protect them from
all chance injury, as well as from the violence of any personal
enemy who might bear them ill&ndash;will.</p>

<p>The deliberations of the Indian tribes are, in fact, carried
on in a manner more strongly resembling those of civilised
nations than is usually believed; that is, a few leading men
meet together, and arrange the plan of operations to be pursued,
after which they convoke the grand council, by whatever
name it may be called, and insensibly lead its members to
propose, second, and carry the measures previously agreed
upon. Thus it was with the Crows upon the present occasion.
The old chief of the band, as soon as he learnt the safe return
of Bending&ndash;willow, sent for his son the White&ndash;bull, whose
rank as leader of the braves entitled him to be present at a
secret council; two other warriors, of more advanced age and
experience, were also admitted; and these four being assembled,
they entered upon their deliberations with a freedom of thought
and speech such as could not have been consistent with the
forms and usages of a public meeting.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to relate in order the various arguments
that were adduced by the several speakers in turn; suffice it
to say, that the father of White&ndash;bull, independent of his
claim to authority as chief, happened to be the oldest man and
the greatest rogue present; all which concurrent advantages
gave a preponderating influence to his advice. The result
was, as might have been expected, its adoption by the unanimous
consent of his three companions; and, as the aftermovements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
of the band were regulated by it, a brief sketch of
its purport and objects will not be misplaced.</p>

<p>His counsel, stript of Indian imagery and ornament, was
that they should for the present detain the prisoners; and in
order to avoid the consequences of the violent ebullition of
resentment which might be expected on the part of the white
men and Delawares, that they should instantly decamp, and
marching towards the south and west by the most intricate and
difficult passes, make their way to the neighbourhood of the
district where Mahéga informed them that he had concealed
his goods and stores. These it was their intention, of course,
to appropriate, and afterwards to deal with their dangerous and
haughty possessor as might be found most expedient. Meanwhile
it was certain that the allied band would follow their
trail for the recovery of the prisoners; and if they did so,
with their baggage and Prairie&ndash;bird’s tent, the Crows had little
fear of being overtaken, excepting when they chose to halt for
the purpose; if, on the contrary, the allied band should divide,
the chief knew that from the intimate acquaintance of his
warriors with the localities, they would easily find means to
attack and overcome the weakened party left in charge of the
tent and its wonderful mistress.</p>

<p>The outline of operations being settled, it was further
agreed that the prisoners should be entrusted to the care of
White&ndash;bull, who made himself responsible for their security,
and who was to lead the van of the retreat, while Besha was
summoned, and ordered to explain to the Osage chief the
proposed plan of operations, and that to him was to be assigned
the honourable post of defending the rear of the march.</p>

<p>In consequence of all these preliminary arrangements, a
formal council was summoned, at which they were proposed
and agreed upon, with the sanction of the Medicine, and a
treaty was entered into with Mahéga, by which he bound himself
with his companions to fight faithfully for the Crows,
and to make over to them one half of his goods concealed in
the câche, on condition that they should do every thing in their
power to recover for him the Great Medicine of the tent, and
his baggage now in the hands of the Delawares.</p>

<p>These arrangements and agreements were no sooner completed
than they were carried into execution with a speed,
order, and noiseless silence peculiar to these roving tribes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
whose fate is so often dependent upon the secrecy and celerity
of their movements.</p>

<p>While these things were going forward in the Crow camp,
Reginald sat by the side of Prairie&ndash;bird under the small cedar&ndash;tree
in front of her tent. Being still somewhat stiff from the
wounds and bruises received in the late attack, he gladly availed
himself of that pretext for enjoying a few hours of repose in
the society of his beloved, while he left the chief care of the
defence of the camp to Baptiste and War&ndash;Eagle.</p>

<p>His eye wandered occasionally across the valley below, and
scanned with an anxious look the opposite hill upon which the
dusky figures of the Crows were seen moving to and fro
between the lodges and bushes, until it returned to rest upon
the lovely countenance of his companion: that countenance,
which was now lighted up by the parting rays of the declining
sun, beamed with emotions too deep for utterance.</p>

<p>Her love for Reginald was not like the love so often found
in the artificial world of society, a mere preference, engendered,
perhaps, by fancy, and nurtured by habit, accident, or mere
congeniality of tastes; but a single absorbing passion, the
intensity of which she trembled to acknowledge even to herself.
All the poetry, the enthusiasm, the yearnings of womanly
feeling in her nature were gathered into a focus, and nothing
but her strong and abiding sense of religion prevented that
love from being idolatry.</p>

<p>As her eye fell upon the recent scar upon his forehead, and
the sling in which his left arm was enveloped, she remembered
that twice already had his blood been shed in her defence—twice
had her life been saved at the risk of his own.
Tears of delicious gratitude, tears sweeter than any smiles that
ever dimpled the cheek of joy began to flow, and half averting
her face from her lover, she turned it thoughtfully towards
the western horizon.</p>

<p>The orb of the sun had just disappeared behind the rugged
and far&ndash;distant mountain range, whose towering and snow&ndash;clad
peaks stood out in clear relief from the deep masses of cloud
whose wavy edges still reflected his golden light. A mellowed
haze wrapped as in a saffron mantle the nearer hills, whose
irregular forms, some rocky and precipitous, others undulating
and covered with dense forests of pine and cedar, formed the
foreground of the magnificent evening landscape. A single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
star glimmered palely in the twilight heaven, a forerunner of
the thousand glorious lights about to emerge from its unfathomed
vault. To look up from nature to nature’s God was
the habitual process of Prairie&ndash;bird’s mind, a habit resulting
partly from the fatherly instructions of the missionary, but
chiefly from her constant study of the Scripture amid scenes
calculated to impress its lessons most deeply upon her.</p>

<p>Such a scene was that now before her; and as the deepening
shadows fell upon mountain, forest, and vale, a holier calm
stole over the current of her thoughts, and imparted to her
eloquent features an expression in which the sweet consciousness
of reciprocated earthly affection was blended with adoring
gratitude to Him whose everlasting name is Love.</p>

<p>The earnest and affectionate gaze of Reginald was still
riveted upon her countenance, when a gentle sigh fell upon
his watchful ear. Taking her hand within his own, he whispered,
“Is Prairie&ndash;bird sad?—Does any sorrow disturb her
peace?”</p>

<p>Dropping to the earth those humid eyes so late upraised to
heaven, she replied, in a hesitating voice, “Not sad, dear
Reginald, but ... afraid.”</p>

<p>“Afraid! dearest; and of what? Nay, blush not, but tell
me your cause of fear.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of too much happiness, of too much love. I
tremble, and doubt whether my thoughts are such as God
approves.”</p>

<p>“Be not rash nor unjust in self&ndash;condemnation,” said Reginald,
in a chiding tone, while secretly delighted by a confession
which his heart interpreted aright; “think you that the
Creator who implanted these affections within us, and who
has pronounced repeated sanctions and blessings upon the
bond of wedded love; think you, dearest, that He can be
offended at your love for one to whom you have plighted your
troth, and who, albeit in many respects unworthy of such a
treasure, has at least the merit of repaying it an hundredfold!”</p>

<p>“Unworthy!” repeated Prairie&ndash;bird, in a tone of reproachful
tenderness,—other words trembled upon her lips, but the
instinct of maidenly reserve checked their utterance, and she
was silent.</p>

<p>“Nay, if you like not the word, it shall be unsaid,” whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
Reginald, gently pressing the hand which he held within
his own; “and my whole future life shall be a constant endeavour
to make it untrue. Let me, however, guess at the
secret cause of your fear, and of the sigh that escaped you,—you
were thinking of your dear fatherly instructor, and were
afraid that he would not return?”</p>

<p>“Indeed my thoughts were not of him at the moment,”
she replied, with earnest simplicity; “nor am I afraid on his
account.”</p>

<p>“Why, is he not yet in the hands of an enemy whose
cruelty and treachery are proverbial? What if the Crow
chief should, in spite of his solemn promise, refuse to give up
his prisoners?”</p>

<p>“It cannot be,” she replied gravely; “God will not permit
such falsehood.”</p>

<p>“You speak,” said Reginald, “like one who has studied
chiefly your own heart, and the precious book now lying at
your side; but even there you may have read that the Almighty
sometimes permits falsehood and wickedness to triumph upon
earth.”</p>

<p>“It is too true,” replied Prairie&ndash;bird; “yet I feel a strong
assurance that our friends will return to us in safety. I
cannot tell whence it comes—whether from a dream sent in
the watches of the night, or the secret whispers of some mysterious
and unseen counsellor, but it brings hope, rest, and
comfort to my heart.”</p>

<p>“God forbid,” said Reginald passionately, “that I should
say any thing likely to banish such sweet guests from so sweet
a home. But if the Crow chief should be guilty of this
treacherous act of falsehood, I will endeavour to inflict upon
him a vengeance so signal as shall deter him and his tribe
from any future repetition of the crime.”</p>

<p>“It is lawful,” replied the maiden, “to recover our friends
by force or device, if they are detained by treachery; but
remember, dear Reginald, that vengeance belongs not to our
erring and fallen race; if the Upsaroka should sin as you
expect, defeat, if you can, his evil schemes, but leave his
punishment to the Great Avenger, who can make his latter
days loathsome as those of Gehazi, or his death sudden and
fearful as that of Ananias and his guilty spouse.”</p>

<p>Reginald coloured deeply, for his conscience reminded him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
that on a late occasion he had used, in a discussion with War&ndash;Eagle,
the same argument as that now applied with so much
force to himself, and he felt ashamed of having forgotten, in
the excitement of his own passions, a truth which he had
laboured strongly to impress upon another.</p>

<p>“Thanks, dearest monitress,” he replied, “for recalling me
to my better self; would that you were always by my side to
control my impatience and reprove the hastiness of my temper.
Nay, I trust ere long that you will be always at my side;
your father and instructor will return, and will unite us in
those holy bands not to be severed by man. You will then
leave the prairie and the tent, and come with me to a home
where a second father and a loving sister claim a share in your
affection.”</p>

<p>“It shall be so,” replied Prairie&ndash;bird, in a low and earnest
voice; “read my answer in the language of one who, like
myself, was humble and friendless, but who, trusting in her
God, found in a strange land a husband and a home.”</p>

<p>“Nay, read it to me,” said Reginald, anticipating her selection;
“however beautiful the words may be, your voice will
make them fall more sweetly on my ear.”</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird opened the book, but she looked not on the
page, for the words were treasured in her heart; and she repeated,
in a voice faltering from deep emotion, “Whither
thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge;
thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God. Where
thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried; the Lord do
so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and
me.”</p>

<p>As she concluded these words, she looked up to the face of
her betrothed with eyes beaming with truth and affection. The
strong man was overcome; he could only utter a deep Amen.
The consciousness that the trustful, guileless being now at his
side had surrendered to his keeping the ark of her earthly
happiness, mingled an awful responsibility with the more
tender feelings that possessed his inmost soul; he felt what
has been so truly described by a poet out of fashion and out
of date,—that</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“The treasures of the deep are not so precious<br />
As are the concealed comforts of a man<br />
Locked up in woman’s love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">Then did he record a secret and solemn vow that he would
guard his precious treasure with a miser’s care; the stars
began more brightly to twinkle in the sky, the watch&ndash;fires
emitted through the deepening gloom a clearer ray; and as
the head of Prairie&ndash;bird lightly rested upon her lover’s
shoulders, they gave themselves up to the delicious reveries
suggested by the hour, the scene, and hearts overcharged
with bliss.</p>

<p>The happy pair were suddenly aroused from their waking
dream by the sharp crack of a rifle, the flash of which Reginald
distinctly saw through the bushes on the side of the hill
below them; a bullet whizzed close to his head, and a half&ndash;suppressed
cry broke from Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p>“Speak, love, speak!” he exclaimed, in frantic alarm;
“speak but one word to tell me you are not hurt!”</p>

<p>“I am not hurt,” she replied; “God be praised that you
are also unharmed! Nay, dearest, do not break from me.”
Here the report of fire&ndash;arms was again heard, mingled with
the shouts and tumult of a sudden fray. “Our friends are
on their guard! you are still weak from your late wound!
Oh, Reginald, stay! I entreat—I implore!”</p>

<p>But he heard her not; the din of arms and the foul
attempt at murder, directed, as he believed, against the life of
his betrothed, had awakened the tempest within him; the
wounded arm was released from its sling, and with drawn
cutlass in his right hand, he rushed down the steep slope of
the hill with the reckless speed of a madman. We will now
proceed to explain the cause of this sudden interruption of
their <i>tête&ndash;à&ndash;tête</i>.</p>

<p>It has been already mentioned that Besha had been charged
with explaining to Mahéga the arrangements and plans
adopted at the Upsaroka council. No sooner had he done so,
than the Osage chief, finding that the evacuation of the camp
was to take place during the night, resolved upon striking,
before they withdrew from the neighbourhood, one blow at the
foes who had defeated and baffled him.</p>

<p>Too cunning to be deceived by the Crows, or to be misled
by the flattery of Besha, he knew that as he had now no
more presents to offer, his only chance of retaining any
authority or influence with them was by such deeds of daring
as should compel them to look up to him as a war&ndash;leader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
This feeling, stimulated by his thirst for revenge, led him
without hesitation to attempt a feat which, if successful, must
render him the terror not less of his allies than of his foes.</p>

<p>As soon as the horse&ndash;dealer had left him, he summoned his
few remaining followers, and informed them that they must
prepare to march during the ensuing night; he told them,
also, that he was about to set forth himself on the war&ndash;path
alone, and all that he required of them was to conceal themselves
among the bushes fronting towards the enemy’s camp,
so as to cover his retreat in case of his being pursued from that
quarter, and that he intended to return, if possible, on a horse.</p>

<p>The men listened with silent attention to their leader’s
orders, and retired without making either comment or reply.
Mahéga then stripped himself of every ornament that could
attract attention, and threw off his hunting&ndash;shirt and leggins,
thrusting a brace of small pistols and a long knife into his
waist&ndash;belt; and with no other covering than a light pair of
mocassins on his feet, he stole out of the camp at a point
which was not visible from the enemy’s quarters.</p>

<p>Availing himself of every ravine and undulation of ground,
he made a swift circuit in the distant prairie, and approached
the Delaware camp on the north&ndash;eastern side, where, as has
been before mentioned, it was protected by a precipitous cliff.
He had observed a narrow valley in this direction, not more
than half a mile from the base of the rock, to which the
white men drove their horses for pasture; and as a view of it
was commanded from the height, they were only guarded by
a single man, who drove them back in the evening to the
camp. The man who happened to be on duty there was a
hunter belonging to the band brought out by Pierre, a brave
and somewhat reckless fellow, who had been inured to all the
hardships and risks of a mountain trapper’s life.</p>

<p>The crafty Osage, having succeeded in obtaining the important
advantage of seeing his opponent before he could be
himself perceived, directed his movements accordingly. He
might, perhaps, have succeeded in creeping near enough to
shoot him, and have gained the shelter of his own camp before
he could be overtaken; but such was not his purpose. He
had determined that the bullet now in his rifle should lodge in
the heart of Reginald or War&ndash;Eagle, and no other life could
satisfy his revenge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>Not more than a hundred paces from the spot where the
unconscious sentry sat, with his face towards the Upsaroka
camp, the valley made a bend, becoming at the same place
narrower and steeper in its banks; thither did Mahéga
stealthily creep, and on reaching it found that he was not
within sight of his enemy.</p>

<p>After waiting some time, during which he carefully noted
every brush and hillock that might be made subservient to his
projected plan, he saw feeding towards him a steady old pack&ndash;horse,
whose scarred back and sides showed that he had carried
many a weary burthen over mountain and prairie. The Osage
remarked, also, that the animal had a long laryette of hide
round its neck. As soon as he felt assured that it had passed
the bend, and could no longer be seen by the man on guard,
he caught the end of the laryette, and led his unresisting
quadruped prisoner to a spot further up the valley, where some
thick bushes offered him the means of concealing himself.
Here he twisted the laryette firmly round the fore&ndash;leg of the
horse, and ensconcing himself behind the largest of the bushes,
patiently awaited the result.</p>

<p>As the shades of evening drew on, the hunter rose to collect
and drive his horses to the camp. Having gathered those in
the lower part of the valley, he afterwards came in search of
those that had strayed beyond the bend. When his eye fell
upon the old pack&ndash;horse cropping the long grass, and occasionally
the younger shoots of the adjacent bushes, he muttered
to himself, “The old fool hasn’t sense to know summer
from winter: there he stands, gnawing the twigs off the
bushes, when he might be eating the best grass in the bottom.”</p>

<p>As soon as he reached the animal whom he thus apostrophised,
he laid down his rifle, in order to free the entangled
leg from the laryette. While stooping for this purpose, a
slight rustling of leaves caught his ear; and ere he could
look round, the fierce Osage sprang upon him with the bound
of a tiger. The unfortunate man strove to catch up his rifle,
but the foot of the giant was upon it, a grasp of iron was upon
his throat, and ere he could utter a sound, or raise a hand, the
knife of the savage was buried in his heart.</p>

<p>Having thus far succeeded in his plan, Mahéga dressed himself
from head to foot in the clothes of his victim, taking possession
at the same time of his knife and pistols, having first deliberately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
scalped him,—and placed the scalp in his own belt,
below the ill&ndash;fated hunter’s shirt. When thus accoutred and
attired, the Osage grinned with satisfaction, and proceeded to
the next and more dangerous portion of his enterprise.</p>

<p>His first step was to select and secure the best horse from
those pasturing in the valley, which he bridled with the laryette
already mentioned; and having slung the hunter’s rifle
over his shoulder, he mounted his newly&ndash;acquired steed, and
began leisurely to drive the others towards the Delaware camp.
As soon as he emerged from the valley he came in sight of the
enemy’s sentries and outposts; but the well&ndash;known wolf&ndash;skin
cap and elk&ndash;skin shirt attracted no particular attention, and
he rode deliberately forward until he reached a huge pine&ndash;tree,
the shade of whose branches was rendered yet more dark
by the deepening gloom of evening. Here he fastened his
horse; and leaving the others to find their way as they best
might, he struck boldly into the thicket that fringed the base
of the hill.</p>

<p>Conscious that he was now in the midst of enemies, and
that his life must depend upon his own skill and address, he
crept forward up the steep ascent, now stopping to listen for
the sound of a footfall, now straining his eyes through the
dusky shade in search of some light or object by which to
direct his course. Knowing every inch of the ground, he was,
soon able to distinguish the angle of the stockade, and at no
great distance above it the white tent, partially lighted up by a
fire, round which were seated Monsieur Perrot, Pierre, and
several others.</p>

<p>As night drew on, and the surrounding scenery became involved
in deeper gloom, the watch&ndash;fire emitted a stronger
light, by which Mahéga caught, at length, a view of Reginald
seated by the side of Prairie&ndash;bird. All the stormy passions in
his breast, jealousy, hatred, and revenge, were kindled at the
sight; and as soon as he thought the muzzle of his rifle truly
aimed at his rival’s heart, he fired. Fortunate was it for Reginald,
that the light cast by the fire was flickering and uncertain,
or that hour had been his last.</p>

<p>The savage, without waiting to see the result of his shot,
which had alarmed the hunters and the Delawares patrolling
near the spot, rushed down the hill towards the tree where he
had left his horse. Twice was his path crossed by an enemy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
the first he felled with a blow on the head from the discharged
rifle; and the second, which was no less a person than honest
Baptiste himself, he narrowly missed, in firing a pistol in his
face at so near a distance that, although unhurt by the ball, his
cheek was singed by the powder.</p>

<p>Completely taken by surprise, the guide fired into the
bushes after the retreating figure of his unknown foe, and
then dashed forward in pursuit; but the darkness favoured
the escape of the Osage, who never paused nor turned again
until he reached the spot where he had fastened the horse;
then vaulting on its back, he shouted his insulting war&ndash;cry, in
a voice that might be heard above all the mingled sounds of
pursuit, struck his heel into the flank of the captured steed, and,
unscathed by any of the bullets that whistled after him, reached
the Crow camp in safety.</p>

<p>The Osage warriors looked with some surprise upon their
chief in his unusual attire, but he briefly returned their greeting,
and proceeded without delay to the lodge of the Upsaroka
chief. A fire was burning there, by the light of which he
recognised the old man seated in the midst, with his son
White&ndash;Bull on his right, and Besha at some distance on his
left. Mahéga had by this time thrown off the garments
of the slain hunter, which were slung across the
horse. Leading the latter forward, until the light of the fire
fell upon it and upon himself, he stood a moment in an attitude
of haughty and silent expectation. White&ndash;Bull and his father
raised their eyes in surprise at the sudden appearance of
their guest, and in involuntary admiration of his herculean
figure, the fine proportions of which were seen to advantage
by the ruddy glare of the blazing logs.</p>

<p>“Let Besha tell my brother he is welcome,” said the old
chief, cautiously; “and let him inquire whence he comes,
and what he has to say.”</p>

<p>“Mahéga is come,” replied the proud Osage, “from a
visit to the pale&ndash;faces and the Lenapé women. His hands are
not empty; the shirt, the leggins, the belt, the head&ndash;dress, and
the horse of a white hunter he has brought as a present to the
Upsaroka chief. If White&ndash;Bull will receive the <i>Medicine&ndash;weapon</i><a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>,
the heart of Mahéga will be glad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>White&ndash;Bull and his father accepted the offered presents with
every demonstration of satisfaction. The latter, again addressing
Besha, desired him thus to speak:</p>

<p>“Mahéga forgets that all his goods are in the hands of his
enemies—does he keep nothing for himself?”</p>

<p>The Osage made no reply, but, drawing the recent scalp
from his belt, and pointing to it, the knife still red with human
blood, he smiled scornfully, and strode through the camp back
to his own lodge. His purpose was effected; he had succeeded
in his daring exploit, and, although uncertain of the
result of the shot fired at Reginald, he had regained some of
his influence over the Upsaroka chief and his intractable son.
Mahéga pondered over these things in his lodge, as he mechanically
attached the scalp of his last&ndash;killed foe to a thong, on
which were already fastened many similar trophies of his
former prowess.</p>

<p>His musings were soon disturbed by the voice of Besha,
who entered the lodge, bearing a sack of considerable dimensions,
which he deposited upon the ground. “Mahéga is a
great warrior,” said he, greeting the Osage with something of
the reluctant courtesy which a terrier shows to a mastiff: “his
name will be heard far among the tribes of the Upsaroka
nation. The Great Chief wishes to make his Washashee
brother a present: three horses stand without the lodge to carry
the followers of Mahéga on the path of the bison, or of the
Lenapé.”</p>

<p>The eye of the chief brightened with fierce pleasure at this
announcement, as two of his few remaining men were unhorsed;
and he satisfied himself, by going to the door of the
lodge, that the horses now presented to him were good and fit
for service.</p>

<p>“That is not all,” continued the horse&ndash;dealer; “White&ndash;Bull
knows that the Medicine&ndash;weapon cannot live without food,
he has sent me to offer this bag to Mahéga.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Besha opened the sack, and exposed to the
view of the Osage powder and lead sufficient for fifty or sixty
shots, and half&ndash;a&ndash;dozen pair of strong mocassins, such as are
made by the Crow women for their lords.</p>

<p>“The hand of the Upsaroka is open,” said Mahéga; “tell
him that his gifts shall not fall upon the ground; the lead
shall be buried in the hearts of his enemies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>Besha, having given to the chief a few brief explanations
of the hour and the arrangements fixed for the night&ndash;march,
withdrew, and left him to communicate with his followers.</p>

<p>We must now return to Reginald Brandon, whom we left
engaged in the disagreeable and perilous task of pursuing an
unseen enemy down the slope of a steep hill in the dark. His
was not, however, a foot or a heart likely to fail him in such
an emergency, and, reckless alike of obstacles or of the difficulties
in his path, he continued his rapid descent, and soon
found himself among the glades and bushes whence the firing
had aroused his attention. Advancing with his drawn cutlass
still in his hand, he stumbled over something which he found
to be the prostrate form of a man, and in whom he recognised
by his dress one of his own party. Finding that he could
extract from him nothing but broken and muttered sentences,
about “the devil” and “the darkness,” he hastened on until
he reached a spot where he heard several voices in earnest conversation;
these he found to be War&ndash;Eagle, Wingenund, and
Baptiste; and he soon gathered from the latter all that he had
to tell, which was, that, having suddenly heard the crack of a
rifle in the camp, and then seen a man rushing through the bushes
in descending the hill, he had thrown himself in the way of
the stranger, who, after nearly blinding him by the discharge
of a pistol in his face, had darted past him into the thicket
below. “I fired after him,” continued the honest guide,
“both pistol and rifle, but I scarcely think I hit him, for on
reaching the edge of the timber, I could just distinguish a horseman
crossing the prairie at full speed to the Crow camp; ’tis
a bad business, but I fear there is worse yet behind.”</p>

<p>“How mean you?” inquired Reginald.</p>

<p>“Why, I fear some foul play in our own camp; the fellow
who shot the pistol at me was one of our party.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” said Reginald; “I will not believe it.”</p>

<p>“Neither would I, if I could help it,” replied the guide;
“but, dark as it was, I could plainly see the fur&ndash;cap and elk&ndash;shirt
upon him; whoever it was, he joined Mahéga on the
prairie, for the Washashee shouted his cursed war&ndash;whoop aloud
to insult us.”</p>

<p>Wingenund here whispered a few words to War&ndash;Eagle, who
replied, “Right, my young brother, let us visit the posts and
the fires, we shall soon see who is missing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>While the chief, with the aid of Pierre and Baptiste, undertook
this task, Reginald returned, accompanied by Wingenund,
to the spot where he had stumbled over the wounded
man. They found him seated in the same place, but his senses
had returned, and with the exception of the severe bruises on
the head, they were glad to learn that he was uninjured. He
could give no account of what had passed further than that
already given by Baptiste. He had been prostrated and
stunned by a heavy blow from some one descending the hill
with great rapidity; he also stated his impression that he had
distinguished the dress of a white hunter.</p>

<p>The result of the investigation may of course be anticipated;
the unfortunate owner of the wolf&ndash;skin cap was suspected of
having plotted with Mahéga, and (after aiding him in an
attempt to murder Reginald) of having gone off with one of
the best horses to the Crow camp. Such was the conjecture
of some, and if there were others who guessed more nearly at
the truth, their opinions were for the present reserved; it being,
however, impossible to make further inquiry until daylight,
the different parties retired to their respective quarters, and
Reginald again sought the tent to give to Prairie&ndash;bird an
account of what had passed, and to assure her of his safe
return. At the first sound of his voice she came forth, and
listened with breathless attention to his brief narration. The
watch&ndash;fire had been fed with fresh fuel, and its light falling
upon her countenance, enabled her lover to see the intense
anxiety which it expressed; a handkerchief, hastily folded like
a turban, covered her head, and a dark Mexican mantle was
thrown over her shoulders; her hand trembled in his, and a
slight shudder passed through her frame as he mentioned the
name of Mahéga.</p>

<p>“Nay, dearest,” said Reginald, “I shall grieve, indeed, if
the name of that hateful savage hath power so to move and
disturb your peace. Fear him not: believe me, we shall yet
defeat all his attempts, whether of hidden fraud or open force.”</p>

<p>“There is no room, dear Reginald, for thoughts of fear for
the future in my heart, ’tis already full, too full, of gratitude
for the past; you are again by my side, safe and unhurt. Yet,
methinks, I am sadly changed of late! A short time since,
the report of the rifle, the arrow’s hissing path, brought no
terror to my ear, and now I tremble when I hear them!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
Will you not regret having chosen a coward for your
bride?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may,” said Reginald, “when the thirsty
summer&ndash;grass regrets being moistened by the dew of heaven;
when the watchful mother regrets that she has borne the infant
by whose cradle she is seated; when the miser regrets having
discovered an unsuspected treasure; and the weary traveller
regrets having found a fresh spring amid the burning sands of
the desert, then may I perhaps regret having chosen Prairie&ndash;bird
to be to my thirsting heart its summer&ndash;dew, its firstling,
its treasure, its fountain of exhaustless joy and love!”</p>

<p>Although it was not the first time that she had received the
assurance of his affection, her ear drank it in with delight:
the repetitions of love have for his votaries perpetual freshness
and variety.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“How silver&ndash;sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night!”</p>

<p class="pn1">So says one of the fairest creations of the great interpreter of
human passion; yet it is only to each other that these voices
do so sweetly sound; to others, less interested, their parlance
is apt to seem dull and monotonous. Neither would a dinner
of honey, or guava jelly alone, be more nauseous and disappointing
to the appetite of a hungry man than a volume filled
with love&ndash;letters, or love&ndash;speeches, to one in search of literary
food. Duly impressed with this truth, we will spare any further
detail of the conversation that passed between Reginald
and his betrothed, and will content ourselves with relating that
after more than one “Good night!” such as only lovers know,
Prairie&ndash;bird retired into her tent, with her thoughts so absorbed
in one object, that she was scarcely conscious of the
affectionate attentions of her faithful Lita, or of the watchful
care of young Wingenund, who took his accustomed station at
the entrance to the outer division of his sister’s canvasss
dwelling.</p>

<p>An hour before the dawn the wakeful youth arose and
looked abroad. The pale and expiring fires of the opposite
camp were still distinctly visible; but his practised ear missed
the usual sounds of Indian life—the hum of men, the cries
of children, and the barking of curs. Having learnt the use
of Reginald’s spy&ndash;glass, he took it down from the peg on which
it was suspended, and examined the opposite hill. As the
light of day gradually advanced, and objects became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
easily distinguishable, his suspicions became confirmed, and he
resolved no longer to delay communicating them to War&ndash;Eagle.
He found the chief seated at the door of his lodge, in
an attitude which he at first mistook for slumber, but it proved
to be one of deep meditation; for, on the youth’s approach, he
looked up, and said, in the gentle tone in which he always addressed
his beloved brother,</p>

<p>“Wingenund is a foot before the sun; have his ears or eyes
been open during the night?”</p>

<p>“They have,” said the youth gravely; “and the words
that he brings to his brother are not good.”</p>

<p>“The Wolf&ndash;cap hunter is gone to the Upsaroka camp; that
is bad news: is there any worse?”</p>

<p>“Wingenund knows nothing of the Wolf&ndash;cap hunter; but
the Upsaroka camp is like the village of the Lenapé, on the
prairies of the east; there remains in it neither man, nor
woman, nor child!”</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle sprang upon his feet, and hastily desiring Wingenund
to summon Reginald, Baptiste, and Pierre to council,
he descended the hill to the spot where his horses were fastened,
and throwing himself upon the back of the swiftest, he
galloped at full speed towards the opposite camp. As he approached
it, he began to suspect that its apparent desertion
might be only a man&oelig;uvre to draw his party into an ambush,
wherefore he wheeled his horse, and made a circuit round the
base of the hill, at such a distance as to be secure from the
arrow or ball of any marksman hidden among the bushes. As
he gained a spot whence the expanse of prairie was open to
his view towards the south&ndash;west, he saw a body of horsemen
retreating rapidly in that direction; they were already several
miles from the camp, and he rightly conjectured them to be the
rear&ndash;guard of the retiring enemy.</p>

<p>The main body had marched early in the night, and only a
score of the best mounted had been left, to walk up and down
by the fires, to talk aloud, and thus to prevent any suspicion
of their movements from entering the Delaware camp.</p>

<p>Vexed and disappointed, the chief returned to his party,
which he found in confusion and dismay, from their having
just discovered the body of the unfortunate Wolf&ndash;cap hunter,
one of his companions having visited the valley before mentioned,
in search of the missing horse and laryette!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<p>The mystery was now cleared up, and the truth flashed
upon them that Mahéga, dressed in the clothes of their slain
comrade, had actually come within their posts, and, after a
deliberate attempt to shoot Reginald, had singed the beard of
Baptiste, knocked down another of their party, stolen one of
their best horses, and escaped in triumph to his camp!</p>

<p>It may well be imagined how such a complication of
injury and insult aggravated the hatred which they already
entertained towards the Osage. Yet were there many among
the rough and hardy men present, who could not prevent
feeling a secret admiration of his daring and successful
exploit.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">WINGENUND DEVISES A PLAN FOR THE LIBERATION OF HIS FRIENDS,
AND SEEKS TO OBTAIN BY MEANS EQUALLY UNUSUAL AND EFFECTIVE
THE CO&ndash;OPERATION OF THE ONE&ndash;EYED HORSE&ndash;DEALER.—A
FURTHER MARCH INTO THE MOUNTAINS.—WINGENUND PAYS A
VISIT TO HIS FRIENDS, AND THE LATTER MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
WITH A STRANGE CHARACTER.</p>

<p class="pn">It was about a week after the events related in the preceding
chapter, that, in a deep romantic glen, apparently locked in by
impassable mountains, there sat a hunter busily engaged in
changing the flint of his rifle, it having just missed fire, and
thereby lost him a fine chance of killing a bighorn, or mountain
sheep; his countenance expressed little of the disappointment
which would have been felt by a younger man on such
an occasion, and its harsh, coarse features would have led any
observer to believe that their possessor was habituated to
occupations less generous and harmless than those of the chase.</p>

<p>As he fixed a fresh flint into the lock of his rifle, he
hummed, or rather grunted, in a low tone, a kind of chaunt,
which was a mixture of half a score different tunes, and as
many various dialects, but from the careless deliberation with
which he went on with his work, it was easy to perceive that
his mind was otherwise occupied.</p>

<p>Whatever might have been his reflections, they were suddenly
interrupted by a hand laid upon his shoulder, which
made him start as if he had been stung by a serpent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
Springing to his feet, and instinctively dropping the muzzle of
his rifle to the breast of his unexpected visitor, he exclaimed,
after a momentary pause, “Does Wingenund come as a
friend or an enemy?”</p>

<p>“Neither,” replied the youth, scornfully. “Wingenund
has no friendship for a forked tongue; and if he had come
as an enemy, Besha would not now have been alive to ask the
question; ‘twas as easy to shoot him as to touch his shoulder.”</p>

<p>“For what, then, is he come?” inquired the horse&ndash;dealer,
who, although somewhat abashed at this reproof, was not disposed
to endure the tone of superiority assumed towards him
by the young Delaware.</p>

<p>“He is come to speak to Besha, and then to return; this
is not a place to throw away words and time.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is not, for Wingenund knows that his enemies
are within hearing of a rifle&ndash;shot.”</p>

<p>“There may be other rifles nearer than Besha thinks,”
replied the youth, dryly. “Wingenund is not a bird;
wherever he goes his friends can follow him.”</p>

<p>The horse&ndash;dealer cast an uneasy glance around, and muttered
half&ndash;aloud, “If Wingenund is not a bird, I know not
how be came to this place unseen by the Upsaroka scouts, who
are abroad in every quarter?”</p>

<p>To this Wingenund deigned no reply, but entered at once
upon the business upon which he had come. As he explained
his proposal, the single eye of his auditor seemed to dilate
with unfeigned astonishment, and at its conclusion he shook
his head, saying, “It cannot be! the mad&ndash;spirit has entered
my young brother’s head. Besha would do much to serve his
friends, but this would hold a knife to the cord of his own
life!”</p>

<p>“The knife is there already,” said the youth sternly;
“Besha has told lies to Netis and to War&ndash;Eagle, and unless
he makes good his first words, their knife or bullet shall find
him on the mountain or in the wood, or in the midst of the
Upsaroka camp.”</p>

<p>For an instant Besha was tempted to rush upon the bold
speaker, and trust the issue to his superior strength; but the
quiet eye of the young Delaware was fixed upon him with an
expression so fearless and resolved, that he involuntarily
quailed before it; and as he was endeavouring to frame some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
further excuse, the youth continued, in a tone of voice less
stern, “Let Besha’s ears be open, it is not yet too late; if he
chooses to be friends with Netis, Wingenund can tell him some
news that will be good for the person whom he loves best.”</p>

<p>“And who may that be?” said the horse&ndash;dealer, doubtless
surprised at the youth’s pretending to a knowledge of his
affections.</p>

<p>“Himself,” was the brief reply.</p>

<p>The horse&ndash;dealer’s eye twinkled with a comic expression,
and a broad grin sat upon his countenance. “Supposing that
my young brother’s words are true, what is the good news
that he has to tell?”</p>

<p>“If the white prisoners are given back unhurt to their
friends, the lodge of Besha shall be more full of gifts than any
lodge on the banks of the great southern river<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>; if not, the
mountain wolves shall gnaw his bones before the change of
another moon: let him choose for himself.”</p>

<p>“My brother’s words are big,” replied the horse&ndash;dealer,
striving to overcome the effect produced upon him by the threat
of the Delaware youth. “The tongues of women are very
brave; if the Washashee tell the truth, not many summers
have passed since the Lenapé were a woman&ndash;people.”</p>

<p>The blood of the young chief boiled within him at this insulting
allusion to an era in the history of his tribe which has
already been explained to the reader, and had he followed his first
fierce impulse he would have instantly avenged the affront in
the blood of the speaker; but he never lost sight of the object
for which he had so long sought an interview with the horse&ndash;dealer,
wherefore he controlled his rising passion, and replied,
“Wingenund comes with this message from those who not
many days ago drove the Washashee and the Upsaroka from
their strong camp: Besha may judge whether they are women
or warriors.”</p>

<p>The horse&ndash;dealer felt, if he did not own, the justice of the
reproof; he knew also that the greater portion of the coveted
goods were in the possession of War&ndash;Eagle’s party, and he
was willing enough to conciliate them, provided he could ensure
a safe retreat from the anger of the Crows, in the event
of his intrigue being discovered by them.</p>

<p>Moved by these considerations, he said, in an undecided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
tone, “My young brother must not forget that the edge of the
knife is on the cord of his life; if Besha agrees to his proposal,
and the Crows discover him, he will be torn in pieces like a
wounded elk among wolves.”</p>

<p>“The life of Wingenund is like the breath of the mountain
breeze,” answered the youth; “it is in the hands of the
Great Spirit, to move and send it whither he pleases. Let
Besha taste this black&ndash;water,” he added, drawing from his belt
a small bottle; “it is very wonderful.”</p>

<p>The horse&ndash;dealer took the phial, which contained a strong,
and not very palatable mixture, which had been borrowed by
Wingenund from his sister’s chest of medicine; but he declined
tasting it, shaking his head in a manner that gave the
youth to understand that he suspected something of a hurtful
or poisonous nature.</p>

<p>“Let not Besha be afraid,” said the youth scornfully;
“the tomahawk and the rifle are the death&ndash;weapons of the
Lenapé, they war not with bad waters!” and as he spoke he
drank a portion of the dark and distasteful liquid.</p>

<p>It would not have been held, according to Indian custom,
an act of unpardonable cowardice in Besha had he any longer
hesitated to taste the pledge; and whatever doubts or scruples
he might in secret have entertained, he concealed them, and
drank off the remaining contents of the phial.</p>

<p>As soon as he had swallowed them, the youth, pointing up
to the sky, said, with much solemnity, “Now Wingenund and
Besha are before the Great Spirit, and they must beware what
they do. This dark&ndash;water was given into their hands by the
Medicine of the white tent: it is made up by Prairie&ndash;bird
from a thousand unknown herbs; it is harmless to the good,
but it is poison to the forked tongue! Has Besha ever heard
of the sickness which makes the skin like a honeycomb; which
spares neither woman, warrior, nor child; and in the course
of half a moon turns a powerful tribe into a feeble and exhausted
band?”</p>

<p>“He <i>has</i> heard of it,” replied the horse&ndash;dealer, trembling
from head to foot at this allusion to that <i>fell disease</i><a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, which
had already begun its fearful ravages among the Indian nations,
and has since fulfilled to the very letter the description
given of it by the Delaware youth. Its origin and causes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
unknown, its cure beyond their skill; it is not therefore to be
wondered at if they looked upon it with a mysterious dread.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Wingenund, “if truth is on the lips and
in the heart of Besha, the medicine&ndash;water will be good for
him and make him strong. If he thinks of falsehood, and
lies spring up in his heart, but he overcomes the bad spirit
within, and treads it under his foot, then will the medicine&ndash;water
give him pain for a short time, but he will recover and
be stronger than before; and if his lips and heart continue full
of deceit, diseases and sores shall come so thick upon his skin
that he shall die among these rocks, the hungry wolf and the
turkey&ndash;buzzard shall refuse to come near the polluted carcase.”</p>

<p>Such, or nearly such, was the warning threat which the
youth held forth in the bold and figurative language of his
tribe; and although Besha could not with justice be called a
coward, and was superior to many of the superstitions of the
Indian nations, still he had heard such well&ndash;authenticated accounts
of the miraculous power of the Great Medicine of the
tent, that the words of Wingenund produced all, and more
than all, the effect he had anticipated.</p>

<p>“It shall be done,” said Besha, in a subdued tone; “let
Wingenund tell Olitipa that the lips and the heart of her
friend will be true, and let him desire her to speak to the
Great Spirit, that the medicine&ndash;water may not hurt him.
Besha will be true; if the Crows discover and kill Wingenund,
the hands of Besha shall be clear of his blood.”</p>

<p>“Let the words of Wingenund remain in Besha’s ears; let
his tongue and his path be straight, and the hearts and hands
of the Lenapé will be open to him. At two hours after nightfall<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Wingenund will be here again.”</p>

<p>So saying, the youth turned; and, darting through some low
bushes, clambered up the steep and rocky bed of a mountain&ndash;torrent
with the activity of a mountain&ndash;cat.</p>

<p>Besha followed with his eyes the light form of the young
Delaware, until it disappeared behind a tall cliff that projected
so far across the narrow gorge as completely to hide its existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
from the observation of any one traversing the valley,
while its rugged and precipitous front might have deterred
the boldest hunter from attempting the passage. The horse&ndash;dealer
then shouldered his rifle, and returned slowly to the
Crow camp, distant about a mile, revolving as he went along
various schemes for ensuring the gratitude of the Delawares,
without forfeiting the friendship of those with whom he was
now allied.</p>

<p>Wingenund had rightly estimated the probable nature and
quality of his reflections, and sundry sharp twitches which he
felt in his stomach served to remind him of the dangerous
liquid which it contained. Warned by these sensations, he
made up his mind to obey the Great Medicine of the tent,
and for the present, at least, to be faithful to the promise
made to Wingenund.</p>

<p>The Delaware youth pursued his way up the rough and
craggy gorge until he reached a cave that he had noticed on
his descent as likely to afford shelter and a secure retreat.
Here he stopped; and ensconcing himself in a dark recess,
whence he could, without being himself discovered, see any
one passing before the aperture, he threw himself on the
ground, and drawing from his belt a few slices of dried bison&ndash;meat,
he made his frugal meal, and quenched his thirst from
a streamlet that trickled down the face of the rock behind
him. While resting himself, he indulged in hopes and reveries
suited to his enthusiastic nature; he was now engaged in
an enterprise such as he had often heard recorded in the songs
of the Lenapé warriors; he was about to trust himself alone
in the midst of a hostile camp, and to risk his life for the
liberation of his early benefactor and the friend of his adopted
brother; he felt the spirit of his fathers stir within his
breast.</p>

<p>“If I escape,” said he to himself, “they shall escape with
me; and if I die, I will not die alone, and the name of Wingenund
shall not be forgotten among the warriors of his
tribe.”</p>

<p>In these and similar meditations he beguiled the hours
until darkness overspread the earth, and the time of the appointed
rendezvous drew nigh; then, once more emerging from
the cave, he picked his way cautiously among the rocks, and
at length found himself at the spot where he had parted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
Besha. Having purposely concealed his rifle in the cave, he
was now armed only with a knife and a small pistol, which
he carried in his belt.</p>

<p>The night was cold and boisterous; dark clouds hung
around the mountain&ndash;peaks, and chased each other in rapid
succession over the disc of the moon, while a fitful gust of
wind swept down the rocky glens, whistling as they passed
among the branches of the scathed pines which were thinly
scattered in that wild and desolate region.</p>

<p>He had not waited long when he heard the sound of approaching
footsteps, and straining his keen sight to its utmost
power, he recognised Besha, who came not alone, but accompanied
by another man.</p>

<p>Although this was an addition to the company that he did
not expect, the youth came fearlessly forward, his quick apprehension
suggesting to him that if treachery had been
intended the horse&ndash;dealer’s companion would have been concealed.
After exchanging a sign of recognition, Wingenund
led the way to a deep recess which he had noted in a rock at
no great distance, where they collected and kindled a few
sticks of withered juniper and sage, which supplied them with
warmth and light without rendering the place of their colloquy
visible from the valley below.</p>

<p>By the light of the fire Wingenund observed with surprise
that the horse&ndash;dealer’s companion, a lad of nearly his own
size and stature, had only one eye, the cavity of the other
being covered with a patch of cloth; his complexion was of a
hue so swarthy, that it evidently contained an admixture of
the negro race: and his hair, though not woolly, was coarse,
long, and matted, differing entirely in its texture from that
of the tribes of purely Indian blood. He was wrapped in a
tattered blanket, and stood apart like one conscious of his inferiority
of station. To account for his appearance without
entering at length into the explanations given by the horse&ndash;dealer
to Wingenund, it will be sufficient to state that the
latter had proposed to enter the Crow camp in a female dress,
and to find an opportunity, as an inmate of his lodge, for
communicating with Paul Müller and Ethelston.</p>

<p>As soon as Besha once made up his mind to forward the
scheme, he resolved to do so with as little risk of discovery
as possible. Happening to have in his lodge a slave, a captive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
taken in a horse stealing skirmish among the Comanches, who
was nearly the same age as Wingenund, he thought that the
youth might personate him more easily than he could imitate
the gait and appearance of a woman.</p>

<p>Many were the jokes among the Crows about the one&ndash;eyed
Besha, and his one&ndash;eyed slave. The latter had lost his eye
by the point of an arrow, in the same skirmish which threw
him into Besha’s power, and being a cunning and dexterous
lad, he soon grew into favour with his new master, who frequently
employed him as a spy, and found him extremely
useful in stealing, marking, and disguising horses for him.</p>

<p>Wingenund saw at once the drift of Besha’s project, and
they lost no time in carrying it into effect. The exchange of
dress was made in a few seconds, and the horse&ndash;dealer then
drew from his pouch a small bladder, containing ointment,
with which he stained the youth’s hands and face, fastening
at the same time a patch over his left eye. Wingenund then
desired Besha to walk up and down, and speak with the lad,
that he might carefully note his movements, and the intonation
of his voice. This observation he continued for some
time, until he thought himself tolerably perfect in his lesson.
There remained, however, one point on which he still felt
himself very insecure against detection. On his explaining
this to Besha, the latter grinned, and drawing from under his
vest a head&ndash;dress of false hair, ragged and matted as that of
his slave, he placed it on the head of Wingenund. The
youth felt his disguise was now complete; and retaining his
own knife and small pistol in his belt, threw the tattered
blanket over his shoulder, and prepared to accompany Besha
to his lodge.</p>

<p>The latter having instructed the slave to keep himself concealed
among the rocks for a few days, and having provided
him with a small bag of provisions, returned slowly towards
the Crow camp, giving to his young companion by the way
such hints as he deemed necessary for his safety. Fortunately
for Wingenund, the lad whom he personated was
known by the Crows to be ignorant of their language, so
there was no great risk of his being betrayed by his speech.</p>

<p>As they picked their way slowly along the base of the
rugged hills which frowned over the valley, they came to a
spot where a few stunted pines threw a darker shadow across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
their path. To one of these was attached a horse, which
Wingenund unfastened by desire of Besha, and led it after
him by the halter.</p>

<p>As they reached the outposts of the camp, Besha was
addressed by several of the sentries, to whom he explained his
night expedition, by informing them that he had been with
his slave to recover a horse that had strayed. They were
perfectly satisfied with this explanation, it being of very frequent
occurrence that both master and man returned by day
and by night with horses that they had “recovered;” the
latter word being in the Crow dialect almost, if not quite,
synonymous with “stolen.”</p>

<p>The lodge of Besha was pitched next to that of White&ndash;bull,
in which Ethelston and Paul Müller were confined.
His entrance caused no disturbance amongst its slumbering
inmates; and Wingenund, fore&ndash;armed with the requisite
local information, tied up the horse beside its fellow; and
nestling himself into his allotted corner, laid himself down
to rest as composedly as if he had been in his usual quarters
in the outer division of his sister’s tent.</p>

<p>While Wingenund was thus carrying his project into effect
his friends fulfilled the intention they had formed of marching
further into the mountains.</p>

<p>“Dear Prairie&ndash;bird!” said Reginald, as they walked together
in front of her tent, “I fear you must be much fatigued
by this last march. I never could have believed that a horse,
bearing a female rider, could have crossed that rocky pass by
which we entered this valley.”</p>

<p>“The horse deserves more praise than the rider, Reginald;
and Nekimi seemed quite aware that his master attached a
higher price to his burthen than it was worth, for he put his
feet so safely and gently down, that I need not have feared his
slipping, even had he not been led by one yet more gentle and
careful than himself.”</p>

<p>“It was, however, a severe trial, Prairie&ndash;bird,” replied her
lover; “for you remember that Lita’s mule stumbled, and
nearly fell with her over that fearful precipice! but Nekimi
is unmatched for speed and sureness of foot, and is of so generous
and affectionate a nature that I love him more than I
ever thought I could have loved a quadruped. When we return
to Mooshanne, he shall be repaid for all his faithful service;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
warm shall be his stable, soft his litter, and his beloved
mistress shall sometimes give him corn with her own fair
hand, in remembrance of these days of hardships!”</p>

<p>At the mention of his home, the cheek of Prairie&ndash;bird
coloured with an emotion which that subject never failed to
excite. Reginald observed it, and said to her, in a half&ndash;jesting
tone, “Confess now, dearest, have you not a longing desire to
see that home of which I have so often spoken to you?”</p>

<p>“It appears to me so like a dream, that I scarcely dare let
my thoughts dwell upon it! But your sister, of whom Wingenund
told me so much, I hope she will love me?”</p>

<p>Reginald bent his dark eyes upon her countenance with an
expression that said, as plainly as words could speak it, “How
could any one see thee, and fail to love thee?” Then turning
the conversation to Wingenund, he replied, “Two days have
now elapsed since your young brother went upon his dangerous
expedition; I begin to feel most anxious for his safety.”</p>

<p>“With grief I saw him go; for even if he succeeds in seeing
and speaking with the Black Father, I cannot tell what
advantage will come from it.”</p>

<p>“They may perhaps devise some scheme for escape, and
will at all events be comforted by the assurance that their
friends are near and watchful. Three several times on the
march hither had we made our plans for attacking the camp,
and rescuing them, but the hateful Mahéga was always on his
guard, and had posted himself in such a manner that we could
not approach without incurring severe loss. War&ndash;Eagle has
himself owned that the Osage has conducted this retreat with
wonderful skill. What a pity that so great a villain should
possess such high qualities!”</p>

<p>“If he were not in the camp of the Crows,” said Prairie&ndash;bird,
“my beloved father and your friend would have been
set free long ago; cruelty and revenge are his pleasures, and
his hand is ever ready to shed blood.”</p>

<p>“He will doubtless do all in his power to prevent their
liberation; and if his malignant eye should detect the presence
of Wingenund, he would represent the brave youth as a spy,
and urge the Crows to destroy him.”</p>

<p>“I trust much to Wingenund’s skill, but more, oh! how
much more to the protection of Him, at whose word the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
strongest bars and bolts are broken, and the fetters of iron fall
from the limbs of the captive!”</p>

<p>“What a strength and support must it be to you, dearest
Prairie&ndash;bird, thus habitually to look up to Heaven amid all the
trials and troubles of earth!”</p>

<p>“How would it be possible to do otherwise?” she replied,
looking up in his face with an expression of innocent surprise;
“Can any one look upon the flowers of the prairie, the beauty
of the swift antelope, the shade of the valleys, the hills and
snow&ndash;clad mountains, the sun, the moon, and the thousand
thousand worlds above, and yet not worship Him who framed
them?”</p>

<p>“I grant you, dearest,” he replied, “that no reasonable
being could consider those things without experiencing the
emotions that you describe, yet many, very many, will not
consider them; still fewer are there who refer the thoughts,
actions, and events of daily life to an ever&ndash;present, over&ndash;ruling
Providence.”</p>

<p>“Surely they can never have read this book,” she said,
pointing to the volume which was her constant companion;
“or they must feel ever grateful for past mercies, present
benefits, and the blessed promises of the future revealed in it!”</p>

<p>For a moment Reginald cast his eyes upon the ground,
conscience reminding him of many occasions on which he had
been led by temptation and carelessness to wander from those
ordinances and precepts of religion which he respected and
approved; at length he replied, “True, my beloved, but the
human heart is a treacherous guide, and often betrays into
errors which reason and revelation would alike condemn.”</p>

<p>“It may be so among the cities and crowded haunts of men,
of which I know nothing beyond what I have read and what
the Black Father has taught me; yet I cannot understand
how a loving heart can be, in such cases, a treacherous guide.
Is it not sweet to serve one whom we love on earth, to think
of him, to bless him, to follow where he points the way, to
afford him pleasure, to fulfil his wishes, even before they are
expressed? If such feelings be sweet and natural towards
one frail and imperfect as ourselves, why should the heart
refuse to entertain them towards the one perfect Being, our
ever&ndash;present Benefactor, the Fountain of Love?”</p>

<p>Again Reginald was silent; the impassioned eloquence of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
eyes told him how her heart overflowed with feelings but
faintly shadowed in her simple language; and he desired
rather to share than to shake her creed. Why should he tell
her, that in spite of all the incentives of hope and gratitude,
in spite of all the arguments of reason and the truths of revelation,
the great majority of the so&ndash;called Christian world
pursued their daily course of business or amusement as if the
present were the substance of life, and eternity a dream?
Reginald felt his own heart softened, purified, and exalted by
communion with the gentle being at his side; the cares and
troubles of life might perhaps disturb at some future time the
current of her lot, but her faith was built upon a Rock that
would not be shaken, and his spirit, already sympathising with
hers, experienced a new and delightful sensation of happiness.</p>

<p>He might have indulged longer in this blissful reverie, had
not his ear caught the sound of an approaching footstep: he
turned quickly, and recognising the light form of Wingenund,
exclaimed, “See, Prairie&ndash;bird, our dear young brother safely
returned! May all your other hopeful anticipations be as
happily realised! Speak, Wingenund; let us hear how you
have sped in your difficult and dangerous mission?”</p>

<p>Instead of giving the youth’s narrative in his own words,
we will resume the thread of his story where we left it, being
thus enabled to relate various particulars which his modesty
induced him to omit.</p>

<p>At the first dawn of day he looked round the horse&ndash;dealer’s
lodge, and made a survey of its inmates. In the centre lay
Besha himself, and by his side a squaw from one of the
southern tribes, who had been the companion of his rambles
and expeditions for many years. Beyond them there slept, or
seemed to sleep, a youth, whose appearance indicated that he
also belonged to a southern clime, and that some Mexican
blood ran in his veins; his features were finely formed, his
complexion darker than that of a northern Indian, and a short
moustachio began to shade his upper lip; his eye was small,
but piercing, and black as jet, and scarcely was the light sufficient
to render distinguishable the objects in the lodge ere his
quick gaze fell upon Wingenund, with an expression that
convinced the latter that the plot had been confided to him.
These were the only inmates of the lodge, which was filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
various indications of its owner’s success in trade, packages
and bales being piled therein to a considerable height.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the plan preconcerted by Besha, his wife invited
Bending&ndash;willow to come to her in the course of the
morning; and, on her arrival, set before her some cakes of
maize, sweetened with sugar,—a luxury equally new and
agreeable to the Upsaroka bride. Further civilities beyond
those interchangeable by signs were precluded between them,
by the circumstance of their being each entirely ignorant of
the other’s language; but the offering of a string of blue
beads after the cakes completed the triumph of the hostess in
the good graces of her guest.</p>

<p>Besha did not lose this favourable opportunity for calling
the attention of the latter to the subject of the prisoners, in
whose behalf he expressed a hope that she would use her best
exertions.</p>

<p>Bending&ndash;willow smiled, and said that she was a woman,
and had no power in the council of the tribe.</p>

<p>The crafty horse&ndash;dealer saw at a glance how the assertion
was belied by the smile, and replied,—</p>

<p>“When White&ndash;bull speaks, the braves listen: when Bending&ndash;willow
speaks, does not White&ndash;bull listen too?”</p>

<p>The Upsaroka beauty looked down and counted the beads
upon her new bracelet, with an expression of countenance
which encouraged Besha to proceed. “These white men are
of no use in the Upsaroka camp; they eat and drink, and kill
no game. If they are sent back to their own people, the
lodge of White&ndash;bull will be full of presents, and the women
will say, ‘Look at Bending&ndash;willow; she is dressed like the
wife of a great chief!’”</p>

<p>By these, and similar arguments, the Crow bride was easily
induced to connive at the plot laid for the liberation of the
prisoners. Being a good&ndash;natured creature, and feeling that
the kindness of Prairie&ndash;bird to her had been ill requited, she
was the more willing to favour the white people, and only
held Besha to the promise that, in contriving their escape, no
injury should be done to the person or property of any of her
tribe.</p>

<p>With the assistance of Bending&ndash;willow, Wingenund found
several opportunities of conversing with Ethelston and the
Black Father; but the camp was so strictly guarded that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
could not devise any plan that seemed to promise success,
while a failure was sure to bring upon them more rigid confinement,
if not a severer and more summary punishment.
Wingenund was authorised by Besha to comfort them with
the assurance that they had a true friend in White&ndash;bull’s
bride, and that they were quite safe from the malignant designs
of Mahéga. On the other hand, the horse&ndash;dealer positively
refused, under present circumstances, to incur the risk
of aiding their escape while the position of the camp was so
unfavourable for it, and the Crow sentries were kept so much
on the alert by the immediate vicinity of War&ndash;Eagle’s party.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the youth had slipped away by
night to consult with his friends whether the liberation of the
prisoners should be attempted by force, or whether it might
not be more advisable to throw the Crows off their guard by
discontinuing the pursuit, and leaving it to the ingenuity of
Wingenund to devise a plan for their escape.</p>

<p>These two alternatives having been duly discussed in council,
it was almost unanimously agreed to adopt the latter; and
Wingenund prepared again to return to his perilous post,
having received from War&ndash;Eagle, Reginald, and Prairie&ndash;bird
the praises which his skill and enterprise had so well deserved.</p>

<p>He did not forget to take with him a small supply of beads
and trinkets, which he concealed in his belt, and which were
destined to secure the continued favour of Bending&ndash;willow.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone, War&ndash;Eagle proposed that the
party should quit their present station in search of one where
they might be more likely to fall in with deer and bison, as
meat was becoming very scarce in the camp; and a scout, sent
out on the preceding day, had returned with a report that he
had found, at the distance of half a day’s march, a large and
fertile valley, watered by a fine stream, and abounding in
materials for fuel. This last consideration was of itself highly
important, for the Crows had gathered every dry bush and
stick from the barren glen in which they were now encamped;
and the utmost exertions of the indefatigable Perrot scarcely
enabled him to provide a sufficiency for cooking the necessary
provisions; while the coldness of the atmosphere, especially
at night, rendered the absence of fire a privation more
than ordinarily severe.</p>

<p>The counsel of War&ndash;Eagle was therefore adopted without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
delay, it having been agreed that two of the most experienced
men, the one a Delaware, and the other a white hunter, should
hover around the Crow camp, and communicate to the main
body, from time to time, their movements and proceedings.</p>

<p>Having been supplied with an extra blanket, and a few
pounds of dried meat and parched corn, these two hardy
fellows saw their comrades depart without the least apparent
concern, and soon afterwards withdrew to a sheltered and
more elevated spot, whence they could, without being perceived,
command a distant view of the Crow camp.</p>

<p>Following the steps of the scouts, War&ndash;Eagle led his party
to a part of the valley where a huge rent or fissure in the side
of the mountain rendered the ascent practicable for the horses.
It was, however, a wild and rugged scene, and a fitting
entrance to the vast pile of mountains that showed their
towering peaks far to the westward.</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird was mounted upon Nekimi, and Reginald
walked by her side, his hand ever ready to aid and guide him
amongst the huge stones, which in some places obstructed the
path.</p>

<p>Never had velvet lawn, or flower&ndash;embroidered vale, seemed
to our hero half so smooth and pleasant as did that rocky pass.
At every turn some new feature of grandeur arrested the
attention of Prairie&ndash;bird, who expressed her admiration in
language which was a strange mixture of natural eloquence
and poetry, and which sounded to his ears more musical than
“Apollo’s lute.”</p>

<p>What struck him as most remarkable was, that, whether in
speaking of the magnificent scenery around, or of the more
minute objects which fell under her observation, her spirit
was so imbued with Scripture, that she constantly clothed her
ideas in its phraseology, without being conscious of so doing.</p>

<p>Thus, when in crossing the valley they passed by some anthills,
and, in ascending the opposite height, saw here and there
a mountain&ndash;rabbit nibbling the short moss that overspread the
bed of rock, Reginald directed her attention to them, saying,
“See, Prairie&ndash;bird, even in this desolate wilderness these
insect&ndash;millions have built them a city, and the rabbit skips
and feasts as merrily as in more fertile regions.”</p>

<p>“True, dear Reginald,” she replied, “therefore did the wise
man say in days of old, ‘The ants are a people not strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
yet they prepare their meat in the summer: the conies are
but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks.’”</p>

<p>A little further onward, the pass was overhung by an enormous
cliff, from the top of which a bighorn looked down
upon the party below, the long beard of the mountain&ndash;goat
streaming in the wind. One of the hunters fired at it, but
the harmless bullet glanced from the face of the cliff, while
amid the echoes repeated and prolonged by the surrounding
heights, the bighorn sprang from rock to rock across the
yawning chasms by which they were divided, as lightly as the
forest squirrel leaps from a branch of the spreading oak to
that of the neighbouring elm.</p>

<p>Reginald watched the animal’s progress, and called the
attention of Prairie&ndash;bird to the surprising swiftness and activity
with which it held on its perilous course.</p>

<p>When at length it disappeared behind the angle of an abrupt
precipice, she said, “Does it not call to your mind the description
given of the wild&ndash;ass of the East, in the Book of
Job, ‘Who has sent out the wild&ndash;ass free? or who hath
loosened the band of the wild&ndash;ass? whose house I have made
the wilderness, and the barren land his dwelling? He scorneth
the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying
of the driver. The range of the mountains is his pasture, and
he searcheth after every green thing.’ Tell me, Reginald,”
continued the maiden, after a momentary pause, “can the
creature here described be the same dull patient animal that I
have often seen bearing the packs of the Mexican traders?”</p>

<p>“The same, I believe, dearest, in its origin, and its place
in natural history, but widely different in its habits and
powers, if we may credit the narratives of travellers, whether
modern or ancient. I remember reading a most spirited
description of this same animal in the account given by the
eminent historian<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> of the expedition of the younger Cyrus,
who relates that the herds of them found near the banks of
the Euphrates surpassed the swiftest horses in speed, and were
neither to be tamed nor approached without the greatest difficulty;
and in later times they have been described as abounding
in the wildest regions of Persia and Tartary, where their
flesh is considered one of the greatest delicacies at the table
of the hunter, and even at that of the prince. In order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
distinguish this animal from its humble and degraded kindred
in the West, it has been dignified by the name of the
Onager.”</p>

<p>The conversation was here interrupted by a sudden halt in
the line of march, and Reginald heard the sound of numerous
voices towards the front as of men speaking under surprise and
excitement. When he advanced, with Prairie&ndash;bird at his
side, they made way for him to pass until he reached the
front, where he found War&ndash;Eagle holding by a leathern thong
the most singular&ndash;looking creature that he had ever beheld.
It bore in some respects the semblance of a human being, but
the extreme lowness of its stature, the matted hair by which
it was covered, the length of the finger nails, and the smallness
of the deep&ndash;set eyes, made it almost a matter of doubt
whether it did not rather belong to the monkey tribe.</p>

<p>This was, however, soon dispelled by Pierre, who recognised
in the diminutive and terrified creature one of the race
known to mountain&ndash;hunters under the name of Root&ndash;diggers.
They are the most abject and wretched of all the Indian
tribes, living in caves and holes, and supporting their miserable
existence upon such animals as they can catch, in toils of
the simplest kind, and by grubbing and digging for roots such
as no other human being could eat or digest. The one now
taken by the Delawares had been engaged in the latter occupation
when he first saw them approach, and he fled immediately
towards the rocks. Had he been followed by an eye
less sure, and a foot less fleet than that of War&ndash;Eagle, he
might have escaped, for despite his uncouth appearance, he
was nimble as a mountain&ndash;cat, but the Delaware chief overtook
and secured him; and in spite of all the endeavours made
to reassure him, the unfortunate Root&ndash;digger now looked about
him as if he expected every moment to be his last. Beads,
trinkets, and shreds of bright&ndash;coloured cloth were all held up
to him in turn, but were left unnoticed, and his deep twinkling
eyes roved incessantly from one to another of the bystanders
with an expression of the most intense alarm.</p>

<p>“Are they always thus fearful and intractable?” inquired
Reginald of the Canadian hunter.</p>

<p>“Not always,” replied Pierre; “but the Crows and Black&ndash;feet,
and white men too, generally treat them worse than dogs
whenever they find them: that is not often, for they always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
hide among rocks and stones, and seldom come down so low in
the valleys. I never saw one in this region before.”</p>

<p>“Prairie&ndash;bird,” said Reginald in a whisper to the maiden,
“speak to the poor creature a few words of comfort. Were he
shy, suspicious, and wild as a wolf, that voice would subdue
and dispel his apprehensions.”</p>

<p>“The sweetness of the voice lies in the hearer’s partial ear,”
replied Prairie&ndash;bird, blushing deeply; “but I will do your bidding
to the best of my power; and if I mistake not the poor
creature’s symptoms, I think I can find the means to relieve
them.”</p>

<p>So saying, and leaping lightly from her horse, the maiden
took from one of the packs a piece of baked maize&ndash;cake, and a
slice of dried bison&ndash;meat. Carrying these in her hand, she
approached the Root&ndash;digger, and motioning to the bystanders
to retire to some distance, she deliberately untied the thong by
which he had been fastened, and placing the food before him,
made signs that he should eat. At first the uncouth being
gazed upon her as if he could or would not understand her
meaning; but she spoke to him in the soft Delaware tongue,
and eating a morsel of the cake, repeated the signal that he
should eat with her. Whether overcome by the gentleness of
her manner, or by the cravings of hunger, the savage no longer
resisted, but devoured with ravenous haste the food which she
had set before him. Prairie&ndash;bird smiled at the success of her
attempt, which so far encouraged her, that she again offered
the several presents which he had before rejected, and which
he now accepted, turning them over and over in his hand, and
inspecting them with childish curiosity.</p>

<p>Reginald looked on with gratified pride, saying within himself,
“I knew that nothing could resist the winning tones of
that voice!</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">‘Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,<br />
But music for the time doth change his nature;’</p>

<p class="p1">And where is there music like the voice of Prairie&ndash;bird?”</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ROOT&ndash;DIGGER MAKES FRIENDS WITH THE PARTY.—AN ADVENTURE
WITH A GRISLY BEAR.—THE CONDUCT OF WAR&ndash;EAGLE.</p>

<p class="pn">No sooner had Prairie&ndash;bird gained the confidence of the Root&ndash;digger,
than War&ndash;Eagle, Reginald, and the other chief hunters
approached him with signs of amity and friendship: nevertheless,
he continued shy and suspicious, still refusing to receive
either food or present from any hand excepting that of the
maiden. They were obliged, therefore, to make her their
interpreter, and to endeavour, through her, to acquire the information
of which they were in want respecting the scarcity
or abundance of deer and bison in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In the discharge of this office, Prairie&ndash;bird discovered so
much natural quickness, and at the same time so complete
a knowledge of the Indian language of signs, that Reginald
looked on with the most intense interest, while the maiden,
whose beauty was so strongly contrasted with the hideous face
and figure of the mountain dwarf, maintained with him a conversation
of some length, in the course of which she learnt
that there were few, if any, bison in the neighbourhood, but
that the argali, or mountain sheep, and deer of several kinds,
were to be found at no great distance. She succeeded also, at
length, in so far disarming his suspicions, that he agreed to
act as guide to Baptiste and Reginald in pursuit of game, and
to return with them to reap the reward of his trouble in further
presents from the hand of Prairie&ndash;bird.</p>

<p>The sturdy backwoodsman did not seem to place much
confidence in the fidelity of his new acquaintance, and bluntly
observed to Pierre, “For sure, I never saw an uglier crittur,
and his eyes rolled from side to side with an underlook that
I don’t half like: perhaps he’ll lead us into some ambush of
Upsarokas, or other mountain Ingians, rather than to a herd
of deer.”</p>

<p>“You need not be afraid, Baptiste,” replied his brother
hunter, laughing; “these poor Root&ndash;diggers are harmless and
honest in their own miserable way. They are said to belong
to the Shoshonies, or Snake&ndash;tribe, and are the best of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
Ingians hereabouts; not such fighting devils as the Black&ndash;feet,
nor such thieves as the Crows, but friendly to the Whites.
This poor crittur has been digging for roots many a long day
with that sharpened flint, which you see in his hand. After
you have started on your hunting trip, make him a present of
a good knife. I have watched his eyes roving from belt to
belt; he would give his ears for one, and yet is too frightened
to ask for it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the hint, Pierre,” said his companion, looking
carefully to the priming of his rifle; “thanks for the hint.
I will carry a spare one with me on purpose; and in case we
should fall in with a fat herd, do you, friend War&ndash;Eagle, give
us the company of one of your stoutest men, that he may
assist in bringing in enough meat for the party.”</p>

<p>On hearing these words, Prairie&ndash;bird inquired of the Root&ndash;digger,
by signs, whether one of the mules could not go over
the hunting&ndash;ground. The savage looked first at the animal,
then at the fair speaker, and then, with a grin, gave a most
decided indication of a negative.</p>

<p>The preparations for the hunt were soon made. Prairie&ndash;bird
urged Reginald in a low voice, not to remain too long
absent, a command which he faithfully promised to obey; and
just as he was about to set forth, he led her up to the chief,
and said, “War&ndash;Eagle will take care of his sister?”</p>

<p>The Indian’s proud heart was gratified by this simple proof
of his friend’s unbounded confidence; he saw that no jealousy,
no doubt of his victory over self, lurked in the breast of Reginald,
and he replied, “While War&ndash;Eagle has life to protect
her, Olitipa shall be safe as in the lodge of Tamenund.”</p>

<p>Reginald turned and followed Baptiste and the Root&ndash;digger,
who had already taken their way up the valley, accompanied
by the Delaware selected to aid in carrying home the anticipated
booty.</p>

<p>Leaving them to toil up one rocky steep after another,
wondering at the enduring agility of the Shoshonie dwarf,
who seemed almost as active and sure&ndash;footed as one of the
mountain&ndash;goats of which they were in search, we will return to
the valley where War&ndash;Eagle’s camp was posted, which formed,
as we have before noticed, a pleasing contrast to the savage
scenery around. The stream that flowed through its centre,
fresh from the snowy bosom of the mountain was cool and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
clear as crystal, and the shade of the trees which grew along
its banks was delightfully refreshing after the fatigues of a
summer march, even in a region, the elevation of which rendered
the atmosphere extremely cold before the rising and
after the setting of the sun. Prairie&ndash;bird felt an irresistible
desire to stroll by the banks of this stream,—a desire that
was no sooner mentioned by Lita to War&ndash;Eagle than he at
once assented, assuring her that she might do so in safety, as
his scouts were on the look&ndash;out both above and below in the
valley, so that no enemy could approach unperceived. At the
same time he gave instructions in the camp that none of the
men should wander to that quarter, in order that it might be
left altogether undisturbed.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Prairie&ndash;bird set forth, taking in her hand
a mocassin, which she was ornamenting with stained quills
for the foot of Reginald, and accompanied by her faithful
Lita, who bore upon her hand a bundle containing various
articles belonging to her mistress and to herself, on which she
was about to exercise her talents as a laundress.</p>

<p>They had pursued their respective avocations for several
hours without interruption, when on a sudden they heard the
report of a rifle and the voice of a man shouting, as if engaged
in the pursuit of game. This was an occurrence to which
both were so much accustomed, that they paid at first little
attention to it; but they felt some alarm when they saw one
of their party, a white hunter, coming towards them as if running
for his life. Before reaching the spot where they were
seated, he threw his rifle upon the ground and climbed into a
tree; immediately afterwards a young male, not full&ndash;grown,
of the species called the grisly or rocky mountain bear, came
up, limping as if wounded by the rifle so lately discharged,
and missing the object that he had been following, looked
around him, howling with mingled rage and pain. At length
he caught sight of Prairie&ndash;bird and her companion; and setting
up a more loud and angry howl, trotted towards them. Unfortunately,
the spot to which they had retired was a narrow
strip of wooded ground, projecting into a curve of the stream
above mentioned, and they could not retreat towards the camp
without approaching yet nearer to the wounded bear. There
was no time for reflection; and in the sudden emergency,
Prairie&ndash;bird hesitated whether she should not adopt the desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
alternative of throwing herself into the water, in hopes
that the stream might carry her out of the reach of danger.</p>

<p>At this crisis the crack of a rifle was heard, and the young
bear fell, but again rose and struggled forward, as if determined
not to be disappointed of its prey. Seeing the imminent danger
of the woman, the hunter who had climbed the tree dropped
lightly to the ground, and catching up his rifle, attacked the
half&ndash;exhausted animal, which still retained sufficient strength
to render too near an approach extremely dangerous. War&ndash;Eagle—for
he it was who had fired the last opportune shot—now
sprang forward from the bushes, reloading his rifle as he
came, in order to decide the issue of the conflict, when a loud
shriek from Lita reached his ear; and on turning round he
beheld the dam of the wounded cub, a she&ndash;bear of enormous
bulk, trotting rapidly forward to the scene of action; the
hunter was so much engaged in dealing blow after blow with
the butt of his rifle, that he had noticed neither her approach
nor the warning shout of War&ndash;Eagle, when one stroke from
her terrible paw struck him bleeding and senseless to the
ground. For an instant she smelt and moaned over her dying
offspring; then, as if attracted by the female dress, pursued
her way with redoubled speed and fury towards the spot where
Lita clung, with speechless terror, to the arm of her mistress.
The latter, although fully alive to the imminency of the peril,
lost not her composure at this trying moment. Breathing a
short prayer to Heaven for support and protection, she fixed
her eyes upon War&ndash;Eagle, as if conscious that the only human
possibility of safety now lay in his courage and devotion.</p>

<p>Then it was that the Indian chief evinced the high and
heroic properties of his character; for although every second
brought the infuriated brute near and more near to her who
had been from youth his heart’s dearest treasure, he continued,
as he advanced, to load the rifle with a hand as steady as if
he had been about to practise at a target; and just as the ball
was rammed home, and the priming carefully placed in the
pan, he threw himself directly in front of the bear, so that it
was only by first destroying him that she could possibly
approach the objects of his care. It was a moment, and but
a moment, of dreadful suspense, for the bear swerved neither
to the right nor to the left from her onward path; and it was
not until the muzzle of the rifle was within three yards of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
forehead that he fired, taking his aim between her eyes;
shaking her head as if more angered than hurt, she raised her
huge form on her hind legs, and advanced to seize him, when
he drew his pistol and discharged it into her chest, springing
at the same time lightly back, almost to the spot to which
Prairie&ndash;bird and her trembling companion seemed rooted as if
by a spell. Although both shots had struck where they were
aimed, the second appeared to have taken no more effect than
the first, and the bear was again advancing to the attack, when
War&ndash;Eagle, catching up from the ground a blanket which
Lita had brought down to the brook, held it extended before
him until the monster sprung against it, and with her claws
rent it into shreds; not, however, before it had served for an
instant the purpose of a veil; profiting by that opportunity,
the heroic Delaware dashed in between her fore&ndash;paws and
plunged his long knife into her breast. Short, though terrible,
was the struggle that ensued; the bear was every moment
growing weaker from the effect of the shot&ndash;wounds, and from
loss of blood, and although she lacerated him dreadfully with
her claws and teeth, she was not able to make him relax the
determined grasp with which he clung to her, plunging the
fatal knife again and again into her body, until at length she
fell exhausted and expiring into a pool of her own blood,
while the triumphant war&ndash;cry of the Delaware rung aloud
through wood and vale.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>Alarmed by the shots, the yells of the dying bear, and the
shouts of the chief, several of the party now hastened towards
the scene of action; but before they could reach it Reginald
Brandon, who was just returning into the camp with the
results of a successful chase, caught the mingled sounds, and
outstripping all his companions, arrived, panting and breathless,
on the spot. For a moment he gazed on the strange and
fearful spectacle that met his view. The Delaware chief, supporting
his head upon his hand, still reclined against the body
of his grim antagonist, his countenance calm in its expression,
but both his face and his whole form covered with recent
blood; at his feet lay Lita, perfectly unconscious, and sprinkled
with the same crimson stream; while at his side knelt Prairie&ndash;bird
breathing over her heroic preserver the fervent outpourings
of a grateful heart! Another moment, and Reginald
was beside her; he understood instinctively all that had passed,
and no sooner had ascertained that his betrothed was safe and
unhurt, than he turned with affectionate and anxious solicitude
to inquire into the condition of his friend. “Olitipa is safe
and War&ndash;Eagle is happy,” replied the chief.</p>

<p>By this time the Delawares were all gathered round their
beloved leader, and in obedience to an order which he gave in
a low voice, one of them threw a blanket over his torn and
blood&ndash;stained dress, while another brought from the stream a
bowl of fresh water, which Prairie&ndash;bird took from the messenger,
and held to his parched lips; then, wetting a cloth,
she washed the blood from his face, cooled his hot brow, and
inquired in a tone of sisterly affection, whether he found himself
recruited and refreshed.</p>

<p>“The hand of Olitipa is medicine against pain, and her
voice brings comfort!” replied the chief gently. “War&ndash;Eagle
is quite happy.”</p>

<p>Not so were those around him. His stern warriors stood in
sad, unbroken silence; the features of the hardy guide worked
with an emotion that he strove in vain to conceal, for he knew
that the Delaware would not have retained his sitting posture
by the carcase of the bear had not his wounds been grievous
and disabling; Reginald Brandon held the hand of his friend,
unable to speak, save a few broken words of affection and gratitude:
while Prairie&ndash;bird found at length relief for her oppressed
heart in a flood of tears. So much engrossed were they all by
their own feelings, that none seemed to notice the anguish of
Lita, who still lay in a pool of blood at the feet of him whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
she had long and secretly loved, giving no further signs of life
than a succession of smothered wailings and groans that escaped
from her unconscious lips.</p>

<p>The only countenance among those present that retained its
unmoved composure was that of the chief himself; and a
bright ray shot from his dark eye when one of the bravest of
his warriors laid down before him the claws of the huge bear
and her cub, which he had cut off according to custom, and
now presented as a trophy of victory.</p>

<p>Baptiste and Pierre having conferred together for a few
minutes, the former whispered to Reginald Brandon that
Prairie&ndash;bird and Lita should be withdrawn for a short time,
while War&ndash;Eagle’s wounds were examined, and his real condition
ascertained. Agreeably to this suggestion, Reginald led
his betrothed weeping from the spot. Some of the Delawares
and hunters removed Lita; but not without difficulty, as she
still clung with frantic energy to the torn garments of the
chief; and, as they bore her away, they now for the first
time observed that she had received some severe scratches in
her fruitless endeavour to rescue him from the struggles of
the dying bear.</p>

<p>When all had retired to some distance, and there remained
only by the Delaware the oldest of his warriors, Pierre and
Baptiste, the latter gently lifted the blanket from the shoulders
of the wounded man, saying, “Let my brother allow his
friends to see the hurts which he has received, that they may
endeavour to relieve or heal them.”</p>

<p>The chief nodded his assent, and no sign, save the dew that
stood upon his brow, betrayed the agony and the sense of
exhaustion that he endured. When the tattered remnants of
his hunting dress were removed, a spectacle so terrible was
presented to the eyes of the guide, that even his iron nerves
could not endure it, and, covering his face with his hands, he
groaned aloud, while the exclamation, “Dieu de la miséricorde!”
broke from his lips in the language that they had
first been taught to speak.</p>

<p>The left arm of the chief was bitten through and through,
and so dreadfully mangled that no skill of surgery could
restore it; the shoulders and chest had been lacerated by the
fore&ndash;paws, some of the wounds being wide and gaping, as if
made by a saw or hatchet; these, however, might possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
yield to time and careful treatment; but the injuries that he
had received in the lower part of the body were such as to
leave no hope of recovery, for the bear, in her last dying
struggles, had used the terrible claws of her hind feet with
such fatal effect, that the lacerated entrails of the sufferer
protruded through the wound.</p>

<p>Baptiste saw at a glance that all was over, and that any attempt
at closing the wounds would only cause additional and
needless pain. War&ndash;Eagle watched his countenance, and
reading there a verdict that confirmed his own sensations,
gave him his hand and smiled. The rough woodsman wrung
it with ill&ndash;dissembled emotion, and turned away his head that
his Indian friend might not see the moisture that gathered in
his eye.</p>

<p>A brief consultation now ensued, during which it was arranged
that the carcases of the bears should be carried away,
and the wounded chief gently moved to a soft grassy spot a few
yards distant, where his wounds might be so far dressed and
bandaged as to prevent further effusion of blood. It was also
agreed that the tent and the lodges should be brought to the
spot, so that he might receive all the care and attention that
his desperate case admitted.</p>

<p>These arrangements having been made, Baptiste walked
slowly towards the place where the rest of the party awaited
in deep anxiety the result of his report. As he drew near
with heavy, lingering steps, and his weather&ndash;beaten countenance
overspread with gloom, they saw too well the purport of his
message, and none had courage enough to be the first to bid
him speak. Prairie&ndash;bird clung to the arm of Reginald for
support; the Delawares leaned upon their rifles in silence;
and even the rough hunters of the prairie wore an aspect of
sadness that contrasted strongly with their habitual bold and
reckless bearing.</p>

<p>Recovering his composure by a powerful effort, the guide
looked gravely around him as soon as he reached the centre of
the semicircle in which they stood, and addressing himself
first to Reginald and the white men, said, “There is no cure
for the wounds of the Delaware; were the Black Father himself
among us, his skill and his medicine would be in vain.”
Then turning to the Delawares, he added in their own tongue,
“The sun of the Lenapé Chief is setting. The Great Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
has sent for him, and he must obey: let his warriors gather
round him to smooth his path through the dark valley.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the guide hastened to carry into effect
the arrangements above mentioned, and in a short time the
little camp was moved to the spot where the Delaware reclined
against the stump of a withered alder, over which his followers
had already thrown some blankets and buffalo&ndash;robes to soften
his couch. Hither was brought the tent of Prairie&ndash;bird, which
was so pitched that the outer compartment might shelter the
wounded chief, and might afford to Reginald and Prairie&ndash;bird
the means of watching him constantly, and administering
such relief in his extremity as was within their power.</p>

<p>Lita’s energies, both of mind and body, seemed entirely
paralysed, she neither wept nor sobbed, but sate in a corner
of the tent, whence she gazed intently, yet with a vacant expression,
upon the sufferer.</p>

<p>He alone of the whole party maintained throughout a dignified
and unmoved composure; nor could either the pangs he
endured, nor the certain prospect of a lingering death, draw
from him a word of complaint. He smiled gratefully as
Prairie&ndash;bird from time to time raised the refreshing cup of
water to his lips, or wiped away the drops which weakness
and agony wrung from his forehead. Once, and once only,
did a look of gloom and discontent pass over his countenance.</p>

<p>Reginald observing it, took his hand and inquired, “Is
there a dark thought in my brother’s heart, let him speak
it?”</p>

<p>“There is,” replied the chief, with stern energy, “Mahéga,
the bloody&ndash;hand—the Washashee wolf—the slayer of
my tribe, he lives, and War&ndash;Eagle must go to the hunting&ndash;fields
of the brave, and when his fathers say to him, ‘where
is the scalp of Mahéga?’ his tongue will be silent, and his
hands will be empty.”</p>

<p>“His hands will not be empty,” replied Reginald, breathing
his own impassioned feelings in the figurative language of
his friend. “His hands will not be empty; he can show the
scalps of many enemies; he may tell the ancient people that
he was the war&ndash;chief of their race, that neither Washashee
nor Dahcotah ever saw his back; and that, to save his sister’s
life, he gave his own. Where is the warrior who would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
envy the fame of War&ndash;Eagle, and who would not rejoice in
the glory of such a death?”</p>

<p>These words, and the tone of earnest feeling in which they
were spoken, touched the right chord in the heart of the chief;
he pressed the hand of his friend, and a smile of triumph shot
across his features like a sunbeam breaking through the thick
darkness of a thunder cloud.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">MAHÉGA IS FOUND IN STRANGE COMPANY, AND WINGENUND DEFERS,
ON ACCOUNT OF MORE IMPORTANT CONCERNS, HIS PLAN FOR THE
LIBERATION OF HIS FRIENDS.—A COUNCIL, A COMBAT, AND A
SKIRMISH, IN WHICH LAST THE CROWS RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM
A QUARTER WHENCE THEY LEAST EXPECTED IT.</p>

<p class="pn">We left Wingenund on his way to the Crow camp, revolving
as he went various schemes for the deliverance of his friends.
However slight was the faith which he was disposed to place
in the honesty of Besha, he confidently believed that the horse&ndash;dealer’s
self&ndash;interest would keep him true, at least for the time,
to the party whence the greater rewards and presents might be
expected. He knew also that Bending&ndash;willow was kindly disposed
towards the prisoners, and would do all that was in her
power towards engaging her impatient and hot&ndash;headed husband
to favour their release. Nevertheless, the game to be played
was a difficult one, especially as the consequence of any unsuccessful
attempt might prove fatal to them as well as to himself.</p>

<p>So intent was the youth upon these meditations that he
forgot the distance and the difficulties of his circuitous route,
his light elastic step bearing him over hill and vale with a
speed of which he was scarcely conscious, and long before the
sun went down he found himself at the further extremity of
the mountain pass, which has been before mentioned as leading
into the valley where the Crows were encamped, from a quarter
exactly opposite to that where his own friends were
stationed.</p>

<p>As he was about to step across a small rivulet that trickled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
from the rocks above, lending a greener freshness to the narrow
strip of grass through which it flowed, his attention was
arrested by a recent footmark upon its margin. Starting with
surprise, he stooped to examine it more carefully, it was plain
and distinct, so that a less sagacious eye than his might have
traced its form and dimensions. A single look satisfied him,
and as he rose from his scrutiny, the name of Mahéga escaped
from his lips.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation he resolved to follow the
trail of the Osage, and observe his movements, conjecturing
that these probably boded no good to the Delaware party,
although he felt at some loss to imagine what object could lead
him to a quarter almost immediately opposite to that where they
were encamped.</p>

<p>The task which Wingenund had now undertaken was not
an easy one, for the ground was hard and barren, and the
short grass partly dried by the mountain winds and partly
burnt by the summer sun, scarcely received any impression
from the pressure of a foot, and the youth was compelled to
pause so frequently in order to examine the scarcely perceptible
marks of the trail, that his progress was far from being so rapid
as he could have wished. Nevertheless he toiled perseveringly
forward, his hopes being every now and then refreshed by
finding on the descent of the steep hill&ndash;side an indication of
the Osage’s tread that he could not mistake.</p>

<p>Wingenund had followed the trail for several hours, when
he caught a distant view of a slight column of smoke rising
from a dell, the bottom of which was concealed by intervening
heights. One of these, more rugged and lofty than the rest,
lay at his right hand, and he climbed with some difficulty to
the top of it, in hopes of being able thence to descry the spot
whence the smoke arose. Neither was he disappointed in this
expectation, for on reaching the height, he could see into the
deep bosom of the mountain glen, where he clearly discerned
a large body of men and horses, assembled round a fire; carefully
noting the nature of the intervening ground, he redescended
the hill, and again threw himself upon the trail of
the Osage, which continued, as he expected, to lead him in the
direction of the unknown band.</p>

<p>As he advanced he felt the necessity of using the greatest
caution lest he should inadvertently come within sight of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
scouts or stragglers from the valley below; but fortune and
his own skill so far favoured his approach, that he reached
unperceived a point whence he could more clearly see the
circle assembled round the fire, and could distinguish the
horses and the men sufficiently to ascertain that they belonged
to some mountain tribe bent on a war excursion, as they had
with them neither their women nor their lodges. With
awakened curiosity and interest, the youth now crept to a spot
at a little distance, where a confused pile of huge stones, here
and there overgrown with stunted shrubs, offered a sheltered
retreat, whence, without being himself seen, he could observe
all that passed below. In making his way to the place he was
somewhat surprised to find what might almost be called a
beaten path, upon which the recent tracks of men and horses,
as well as of bison, were clearly discernible.</p>

<p>He had scarcely time to conceal himself, when he perceived
two men coming directly towards his hiding&ndash;place, in one of
whom he recognised the Osage chief, while the other belonged
apparently to some tribe of Indians that he had never seen
before. They came slowly up the path before&ndash;mentioned,
stopping almost at every step, and conversing in the language
of signs, by which means their expressions of mutual friendship
were as intelligible to the quick&ndash;witted youth as they
were to each other. The stranger was a fine&ndash;looking Indian,
and though lower in stature than his gigantic companion, had
the appearance of great muscular strength, and his dress betokened,
according to Indian notions of magnificence, a chief
of high degree. His black hair was clubbed behind his head,
and fastened with several painted feathers bound with fillets
of ermine; his hunting&ndash;shirt was of the skin of the mountain
goat, and both it and his deer&ndash;skin leggins were ornamented
with porcupine&ndash;quills, and fringed with the scalp&ndash;locks of enemies
slain in battle; he carried in his hand a long lance, also
decorated with scalp&ndash;locks, and at his back hung a quiver
made from the skin of the panther, in which bristled a score
of arrows beautifully tipped with sharp flint, and attached to
it by a leather thong was a bow so short that it looked more
like the plaything of a boy than the deadly weapon of a
warrior.</p>

<p>Wingenund wondered to what tribe the stranger might
belong; and as the two Indians seated themselves upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
fragment of rock only a few yards from the recess in which
he was ensconced, he trusted that some signal would pass by
which his curiosity might be afterwards satisfied; at all
events, it seemed clear that they were already upon the best
terms with each other, for they smiled and grinned, each
placing a hand upon the heart of the other, after which Mahéga
extended his arms like a flying bird, and then passed
his right hand with a rapid movement round his own scalp;
from which sign the youth instantly knew that their plot was
to attack and kill the Upsarokas.</p>

<p>“Double&ndash;tongued, cowardly snake!” said Wingenund to
himself, “he made a league with the Dahcotahs to destroy
his Lenapé friends, and now he makes one with a stranger
tribe to destroy those with whom he eats and smokes.”</p>

<p>That the youth rightly conjectured the object of the interview
he could no longer doubt, when Mahéga, pointing directly
to the valley where the Crows were encamped, repeated
again the signals for attack and slaughter. Not a word passed
during this time, excepting when the stranger drew from under
his hunting&ndash;shirt a small whistle, made apparently either from
a bone or a reed, and quaintly ornamented with stained quills
and the down from the breast of some mountain bird; having
applied this to his lips, he drew from it a peculiar sound, not
remarkable for its shrillness, but different from any tone that
Wingenund remembered to have heard before.</p>

<p>After two or three attempts Mahéga succeeded in sounding
it correctly; and nodding intelligently to the stranger, concealed
it carefully in his belt; they then exchanged the names
or war&ndash;cry, by which they were to recognise each other, Mahéga
teaching his new friend to say “<i>Washashee</i>,” and learning
in return to pronounce “<i>Ka&ndash;in&ndash;na</i>,” which he repeated
three or four times so distinctly that Wingenund caught and
remembered it. These preparatory civilities having passed,
they proceeded to the interchange of presents, by which their
alliance was to be cemented.</p>

<p>Mahéga drew from his girdle a pistol, which he gave, together
with a small leather pouch containing lead and powder,
to the stranger chief, who received it with an air so puzzled
and mysterious, that Mahéga could scarcely refrain from smiling.
He turned the pistol over and over, looking down the
barrel, and examining the lock with a curiosity that he cared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
not to conceal; he pointed it, however, towards a mark in an
adjoining rock, and made a sound with his lips, which was
intended to imitate its report, repeating at the same time the
word “sachsi&ndash;nama,” as if to show that the name and use of
the weapon were not strange to him, although he might never
have seen one before. Mahéga then proceeded to show him
how to use it, making signs that with it he might kill all his
enemies; and upon the stranger expressing a wish to see an
instance of its power, he placed a thin flat stone at the distance
of a few yards, and split it in two at the first shot; after
which he reloaded it, showing at the same time the use of the
priming&ndash;pan and trigger.</p>

<p>It was not without a look of gratified pride that he placed
the pistol in his belt, repeating again and again, “sachsi&ndash;nama,”
“nahtovi&ndash;nama.” He then unslung the short bow
that hung at his back, and presented it, with the panther&ndash;skin
quiver full of arrows, to the Osage chief, who received the
gift with every appearance of satisfaction, and they parted,
the former returning towards the encampment of his tribe,
after he had told Mahéga that the name of the bow was
“nutsi&ndash;nâma.”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>For some time after the departure of his new ally, the
Osage remained upon his seat examining the bow, which at
first sight he had considered a mere toy, but which he found,
to his astonishment, required all his force to draw it to its full
power. Being formed of bone, strengthened throughout with
sinew, it was stiff and elastic to an extraordinary degree; and
although not more than three feet in length, would drive an
arrow as far as an ordinary six&ndash;feet bow.</p>

<p>When he had sufficiently examined his new acquisition, it
occurred to the chief that he could not, without risk of detection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
carry it into the Crow camp. He resolved, therefore, to
hide it in a dry cleft of the rock, and take it out again after the
issue of his plot should be decided.</p>

<p>This resolution threatened to bring about an unexpected
catastrophe, as it happened that he approached the very recess
in which Wingenund was stationed. Drawing the knife from
his belt, the youth stood in the inmost corner of the cavern,
ready, as soon as discovery became inevitable, to spring upon
his powerful enemy; but fate had otherwise decreed, and the
Osage passed on to a higher and narrower cleft, where he deposited
the quiver and the bow, carefully closing the aperture
with moss and lichen.</p>

<p>It was not until he had gone some distance on his homeward
way, that Wingenund emerged from his hiding&ndash;place, and
having possessed himself of the quiver and bow, returned
slowly upon the Osage’s trail towards the Upsaroka camp,
proving as he went the surprising strength of the weapon, and
admiring the straightness and beauty of the war&ndash;arrows with
which the quiver was supplied.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Following unperceived, and at some distance, the steps of
the Osage, he found that the latter took a shorter, though a
somewhat steeper and more rugged way than that by which he
had come, so that very little more than two hours of brisk walking
brought him within sight of the watch&ndash;fires of the Upsaroka
camp, just as day closed, and their light began to shine more
brightly through the valley. Availing himself of the shelter
of a stunted pine, the youth lay down for some time, and did
not re&ndash;enter the camp until late at night, when he made his
way without interruption to Besha’s tent, giving to the outposts
by whom he was challenged, the countersign taught him
by the horse&ndash;dealer.</p>

<p>On the following morning before sunrise, Besha was aroused
by Wingenund, who told him that he had news of great importance
to communicate to the Crow chiefs, and that no time
should be lost before they were summoned to council. The
horse&ndash;dealer rubbed his eyes as he wakened by degrees and
listened to this intelligence, which he suspected at first to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
some trick on the part of the youth for the liberation of his
friends; but there was an earnest simplicity in his manner
that carried conviction with it; and Besha endeavoured, as he
threw on his hunting&ndash;shirt, and fastened his belt, to learn from
the youth the nature and purport of his intelligence. The
latter seemed, however, to be in no very communicative mood;
he merely replied; “Wingenund speaks not the Upsaroka
tongue; let Besha repeat to the council word after word what
he hears, that will be enough; he will serve both the Crows
and the Delawares, and will obtain thanks and presents from
both. Let Mahéga, too, be called to attend the council.”</p>

<p>The horse&ndash;dealer having departed upon his errand, Wingenund
found an opportunity to detail briefly to Paul Müller and
Ethelston the discovery that he had made on the preceding
evening; but it may well be imagined that he could obtain
from neither any information respecting the mountain tribe
with whom the Osage was carrying on his treacherous intrigue.</p>

<p>“Let my son boldly speak the truth,” said the missionary,
“and leave the result to God.”</p>

<p>“Wingenund never told a lie,” replied the young Delaware;
and the bright, fearless expression of his countenance warranted
the proud assertion.</p>

<p>“How many are there in our crowded cities and churches,”
said the missionary, looking after the youth as he re&ndash;entered
the horse&ndash;dealer’s lodge, “who dare echo that speech? yet
methinks, as far as memory and conscience serve him, he has
said no more than the truth. I have known him from his
childhood, and believe him to be as much a stranger to falsehood
as to fear.”</p>

<p>“They are cousins&ndash;german, my worthy friend,” said Ethelston,
“and generally dwell together! I wonder not at the
affection which Reginald bears to that youth; nature has
stamped upon his countenance all the high and generous qualities
that endear man to his brother. Let us endeavour to be
present at the council which is now assembling; we have been
such quiet prisoners that perhaps our guards will allow us to
be spectators on this occasion.”</p>

<p>Besha happening to pass at this moment, obtained for them
the desired permission, which was the more readily granted
that the Crow sentries themselves were desirous of seeing what
was going forward, and knew that no danger could be apprehended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
from the two unarmed captives. The spectacle that
met their view when they issued from the lodge was striking
and picturesque; runners had been sent throughout the camp,
and all the principal chiefs, braves, and medicine&ndash;men were
already assembled in a semicircle, the concave centre of which
was formed by the lodge of White&ndash;Bull and his father, the
latter of whom had put on for the occasion a magnificent head&ndash;dress
of painted eagle&ndash;feathers which betokened his rank as
head&ndash;chief of the band. The horse&ndash;dealer stood in front of
his own lodge to the left, and frequent were the glances directed
to him from all quarters, it having been generally understood
that the council was summoned to consider matters
brought forward by him. Behind him stood Wingenund,
wrapped in a loose blanket, which partially concealed his features
and covered entirely the rest of his person; on the opposite
wing of the circle, and at a distance of twenty&ndash;five or
thirty yards, stood Mahéga, his gigantic stature shown off to
the best advantage by the warlike dress which he had put on
complete for the solemn occasion, his neck and arms being covered
with beads of various colours, and his fingers playing
unconsciously with the weighty iron&ndash;pointed mace or war&ndash;club
which had slain so many of those whose scalp&ndash;locks now fringed
his leathern shirt and hose. The warriors and other Indians
of inferior degree stood in the background, and some, anxious
to get a better view of what was going forward, had perched
themselves upon the adjoining rocks and cliffs, where their
dusky forms, dimly seen through the mists which were now
vanishing before the beams of the rising sun, gave a wild and
picturesque effect to the scene.</p>

<p>Nearly half an hour was consumed by the soothsayers or
medicine&ndash;men in going through their formal mummeries to
ascertain whether the hour and the occasion were favourable
for the proposed business, and it was not until the medicine&ndash;pipe
had been passed round, and the chief functionary had
turned gravely to the north, south, east, and west, blowing to
each quarter successively a whiff of medicine&ndash;smoke, that he
gave his permission for the council to proceed with its deliberations.</p>

<p>During all this time a profound silence reigned throughout
the camp, the women suspending their scolding, chattering,
and domestic avocations, and even the children peeping, half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
frightened, from behind their mothers, or stealing away to
some spot where they might laugh and play without fear of
being whipped for disturbing the solemnities.</p>

<p>The venerable father of White&ndash;Bull now returned the great
pipe to the medicine&ndash;men, saying, in a voice distinctly audible
throughout the circle: “Besha has called the chiefs and braves
of the Upsaroka together; they are come—their ears are open—let
the one&ndash;eyed man who brings horses from the far
prairies, speak with a single tongue.”</p>

<p>Thus called upon, the horse&ndash;dealer stepped forward, saying:
“Besha is neither wise in council, nor a chief among warriors;
he has travelled far among the eastern tribes, and he knows
their tongues; he stands here to give out of his mouth what
goes in at his ear. Let the Upsaroka warriors listen; they
are not fools, they will soon know if lies are told to them.
Let them look at this youth; his blanket is that of Besha’s
slave; he is not what he seems; he is a son of the Lenapé, a
friend of the Whites; yet he is come alone into the camp to
show to the Upsaroka that a snake is crawling among their
lodges.”</p>

<p>A murmur ran through the assembly as Besha pronounced
these words, and pointed to Wingenund, who, throwing the
blanket into the hollow of his left arm, advanced to the front,
and with a slight inclination to the old chief, awaited his permission
to proceed.</p>

<p>The youth, the graceful form, the open countenance, and
the dignified bearing of Wingenund, as he stood forward in
the assembled circle, prepossessed the Crows strongly in his
favour, and they awaited with excited curiosity the intelligence
that he had to communicate; but their chief did not
appear disposed to gratify their impatience, for after whispering
a few words to a messenger who stood beside him, he
relapsed into silence, scanning with a fixed gaze the countenance
of the young Delaware. The latter bore the scrutiny
with modest, yet undisturbed composure, and not a voice was
raised in the council until the return of the messenger, conducting
a Crow doctor or conjuror, somewhat advanced in
years, who took his station by the chief, and gave a silent assent
to the whispered orders that he received.</p>

<p>It may well be imagined with what mingled feelings of
surprise and indignation the haughty Osage beheld the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
Delaware thus standing forward in the midst of the council&ndash;circle;
that his presence boded no good to himself he well
knew; but how and wherefore he came, and why he, belonging
as he did to a hostile band, was thus permitted to appear
before the assembly of Crow warriors, he was quite at a loss
to understand. His suspense, however, was not destined to
be of long duration, for as soon as Besha, in obedience to a
signal from the chief, had desired Wingenund to speak what
he had to say, the youth came another step forward, and said
in a clear voice—</p>

<p>“There is a snake among the lodges of the Upsaroka; a
hidden snake, that will bite before its rattle is heard.”</p>

<p>The Crows looked from one to the other as Besha translated
this sentence, and the old conjuror gave a slight nod to the
chief, indicating that the youth’s meaning was rightly given.
It may be as well to inform the reader that the said conjuror
had in early life been taken prisoner by the Pawnees, with a
party of whom he had been conveyed to a great council held
with the Indian agents at St. Charles’s, in Missouri, respecting
the cession and appropriation of territory. Several of the
western Delawares had been present at this meeting, which
was protracted for many weeks, and the Crow prisoner had
picked up a smattering of their tongue, which, however slight
it might be, had occasioned him to be sent for on this occasion
to check any propensity for untruth that might be entertained
by the horse&ndash;dealer. Whether the latter was influenced
by these, or by other motives, he rendered faithfully the conversation
that ensued, and therefore it is not necessary to
notice further the part played by the interpreter.</p>

<p>“Who is it that speaks?” demanded the old chief, with
dignity: “the Crows open not their ears to the idle words of
strangers.”</p>

<p>“Then let them shut their ears,” replied the youth, boldly.
“Before another sun has set they will wish they had listened
to the words of Wingenund!”</p>

<p>“Who is Wingenund? Is he not an enemy? have not
his people shed Upsaroka blood? why, then, should they believe
his words?”</p>

<p>“Wingenund is the son of a Lenapé chief. For a thousand
summers his fathers have hunted over forest and plain beyond
the Great River. Wingenund has heard of their deeds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
he will not stain his lips with a lie. The Lenapé have taken
Crow scalps in defence of their own, Wingenund will not
deny it; but he came here to serve his white friends, not to
hurt the Upsaroka.”</p>

<p>On hearing this bold reply, White&ndash;bull bent his brow
fiercely upon the speaker; but the youth met his eye with a
look of bright untroubled confidence, while he quietly awaited
the chief’s further interrogation.</p>

<p>“Let the son of the Lenapé speak, but let him beware,—if
his tongue is forked, the Upsaroka knives will cut it out
from his head.”</p>

<p>“Wingenund is not a woman, that he should be frightened
with big words; when he speaks, the truth comes from his
lips; and if he chooses to be silent, the Upsaroka knives cannot
make him speak,” replied the youth, with a look of lofty
scorn.</p>

<p>“Is it so?—we shall see,” cried White&ndash;bull, springing
forward, at the same time drawing his knife, with which he
struck full at the naked breast of the youth. Not a muscle
moved in the form or countenance of Wingenund; his eye
remained steadily fixed on that of the Crow, and he did not
even raise in his defence the arm over which his blanket was
suspended. Nothing could have saved him from instant
death, had not White&ndash;bull himself arrested the blow just as it
was falling, so that the point of the knife scratched, but did
not penetrate the skin. Wingenund smiled, and the Crow
warrior, partly ashamed of his own ebullition of temper, and
partly in admiration of the cool courage of the young Delaware,
said to his father, “Let him speak: there are no lies
upon his tongue.”</p>

<p>The old man looked for a moment sternly at his son, as if
he would have reproved him for his violence, in interrupting
the business of the council, but apparently he thought it
better to let it pass; and, turning towards Wingenund, he
said, in a milder tone than he had yet used, “Let the young
stranger speak if he will, his words will not be blown away;
if he has seen a snake, let him show it, and the chiefs of the
Upsaroka will owe him a debt.”</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Wingenund, slowly raising the forefinger
of his right hand, pointed it full upon Mahéga, saying, in a
loud voice, “There is the snake! Fed by the hand of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
Upsaroka, clad in their gifts, warmed by their fire, he now
tries to bite them, and give them over to their enemies,
even as his black heart and forked tongue have before destroyed
those whom he called brothers.”</p>

<p>It is beyond the power of words to paint the rage of the
conscious Osage, on hearing this charge: he concealed it,
however, by a strong effort, under a show of just indignation,
exclaiming aloud, “The Upsaroka warriors are not fools, that
they should believe the idle words of a stranger boy, a spy,
who stole into their camp by night, and now tickles their ears
with lies.”</p>

<p>“The young Lenapé must tell more,” said the old chief,
gravely, “before the Upsaroka can believe bad things of a
warrior who has smoked and fought with them, and has
taken the scalps of their enemies.”</p>

<p>Thus called upon, Wingenund proceeded to relate distinctly
the circumstances narrated in the last chapter. His tale was
so clearly told, his description of the locality so accurate,
that the attention of the whole council was riveted, and they
listened with the most profound attention. A cloud gathered
upon the brow of White&ndash;bull, and the gigantic frame of
Mahéga swelled with a tempest of suppressed passion. Independently
of the dangers that now threatened him, his proud
spirit chafed at the thought of being thus tracked, discovered, exposed,
and disgraced by a boy; and his fury was heightened
by observing the bright eye of the Delaware youth fixed upon
him with a steady searching gaze, indicative at once of conscious
truth and triumph. Still he resolved to hold out to the
last; he trusted that after the great services he had rendered
in battle to the Crows, they would at least believe his word,
before that of an unknown youth, who came amongst them
under such suspicious circumstances. These reflections passing
rapidly through his mind, restored his disturbed self&ndash;possession,
and enabled him to curl his haughty features into an
expression of sneering contempt.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement among the Crows, as Wingenund
described, with unerring minuteness and accuracy, the dress
and equipments of the stranger with whom Mahéga had held
the interview; and there was dead silence in the council when
the interpreter was ordered to inquire whether he knew to
what tribe the strange Indian belonged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wingenund knows not,” he replied; “but he heard the
name that was taught to the Osage, as the battle&ndash;cry of his
new allies.”</p>

<p>“<i>E&ndash;chĭ&ndash;pētă!</i>” shouted the impetuous White&ndash;bull, who
had already recognised in the youth’s description one of the
warriors of the Black&ndash;feet, the hereditary enemies of his tribe.</p>

<p>“It was not so,” replied Wingenund gravely. “<i>Ka&ndash;in&ndash;na</i><a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
was the name; it was twice spoken.”</p>

<p>A deep murmur ran round the assembly, White&ndash;bull exchanged
a significant glance with the nearest of his braves,
and again a profound silence reigned throughout the assembly.</p>

<p>Mahéga now felt that the crisis of his fate was at hand, and
that every thing must depend on his being able to throw discredit
on the tale of Wingenund. This was not, however, an
easy task, for he suspected Besha of a secret leaning to the
Delaware side, while the fierce and lowering looks of the bystanders
showed him how little was wanting to make the
smothered flame burst forth.</p>

<p>These indications did not escape the aged chief, who spoke
a few words in a serious and warning tone, the purport of
which was to remind them that the present council was sacred
to the Medicine, and was not to be desecrated by any violence
or shedding of blood. He concluded by saying, “Let the
Washashee speak for himself, and let Besha give his words
truly, if he does not wish to have his ears cut off.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, the horse&ndash;dealer lent all his attention to
the Osage, who came forward to address the council with an
imposing dignity of manner that almost made the most suspicious
of his hearers doubt the truth of the accusations brought
against him.</p>

<p>Being now in front of the semicircle, which was not more
than twenty yards in width, he was directly opposite to Wingenund,
who stood forward a few feet in advance of its other
wing. The contrast offered by the stature and bearing of the
accuser and the accused, the slight active frame, the youth and
grace of the one, and the haughty air and gigantic bulk of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
other, struck Ethelston so forcibly that he could not forbear
whispering to Paul Müller, “Worthy father, does not the
scene recall to mind the meeting between the Hebrew shepherd
and the giant of Gath?”</p>

<p>“It does, my son; and I misjudge the looks of the Osage
if they part hence without the shedding of blood. I have long
studied his countenance, and, however skilfully he has subdued
its expression, I can trace the full storm of passions raging
within his breast.”</p>

<p>Further discourse was prevented by the commencement of
the Osage’s speech, which he delivered with a tone and gesture
of indignation, suitable to one who declared himself injured
and belied.</p>

<p>He began by recapitulating the services that he had rendered
to the Crows, the faithful warriors that he had lost in
their cause, and their valuable presents concealed in the câche,
to which he was even now conducting them; on the other
hand, he painted the injuries they had received from the Lenapé,
who had come into their country in league with the
white&ndash;skins, the bane of their tribe and race, that their hands
were still wet with Upsaroka blood; and “whose is the forked
tongue,” said he, “that is to cover with lies and dirt the fame
of the great chief of the Washashee, the sworn brother of the
Upsaroka?—Who but a boy, a stranger, a liar, and a spy,
telling his idle dreams to the council to break the friendship of
warriors whom his cowardly tribe, and their pale&ndash;faced allies,
dared not meet in the field!”</p>

<p>During the whole of this tirade, which was delivered with
much vehemence and gesticulation, Wingenund stood motionless
as a statue, his calm eye fixed upon the excited countenance
of his opponent with an undisguised expression of
contempt.</p>

<p>Receiving no reply, Mahéga continued: “Chiefs and
brothers, you are wise in council—men of experience; your
ears will not be tickled with the idle songs of this false&ndash;tongued
singing&ndash;bird; a messenger who brings such news to the great
council of the Upsaroka—who tells them that their brother
who has fought by their side, and smoked at their fire, is a
forked snake, he must bring something better able to convince
them than the cunning words coming from his own lying
lips!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>These words, supported by the commanding tone assumed
by the Osage, were not without their effect upon the minds of
that fierce and deeply&ndash;interested assemblage.</p>

<p>Wingenund waited until the speech of his antagonist had
been translated to them, when he replied, with unmoved composure,
“If the Crow warriors require better witness than
words, it is not difficult to find; they have already been told
that the Kainna stranger gave to Mahéga a present of a bow
and arrows, which he hid in the rocks; Wingenund took them
out, and here they are.”</p>

<p>As the youth spoke he dropped the blanket that had been
thrown over his left arm and shoulder, holding up to the
council the bow and arrows, which all present instantly recognised
as being made and ornamented by the Black&ndash;feet.</p>

<p>“Are the warriors yet convinced,” continued the youth,
raising his voice, “or do they wish for more? If they do, let
them seize the Washashee wolf, they will find in his belt—“</p>

<p>He was not allowed to finish the sentence; the storm that
had long been brooding, now burst in all its fury. Mahéga,
driven to desperation by the damning evidence brought against
him, and reckless of all save the gratification of his fierce revenge,
whirled his iron&ndash;pointed mace around his head, and
launched it with tremendous force at Wingenund.</p>

<p>Never had the latter, even for an instant, taken his falcon
eye off the Osage; but so swift was the motion with which
the weapon was thrown, that although he sprung lightly aside
to avoid it, the spiked head grazed and laid open his cheek,
whence it glanced off, and striking an unlucky Crow who
stood behind him, felled him, with a broken arm, to the
ground. Even in the act of stooping to escape the mace,
Wingenund fitted an arrow into the Black&ndash;foot bow which he
held in his hand; and rising quick as thought, let it fly at his
gigantic adversary, with so true an aim, that it pierced the
windpipe, and the point came out at the back of his neck,
close to the spine. While the Osage, half strangled and
paralysed, tugged ineffectually at the fatal shaft, Wingenund
leaped upon him with the bound of a tiger, and uttering aloud
the war&ndash;cry of the Lenapé, buried his knife in the heart of his
foe. With one convulsive groan the dying Osage fell heavily
to the earth; and ere the bystanders had recovered from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
astonishment, his blood&ndash;stained scalp hung at the belt of the
victorious Delaware.</p>

<p>For a moment all was tumult and confusion; the few remaining
Osages made a rush towards Wingenund to avenge
the death of their chief, but they were instantly overpowered
and secured with thongs of pliant bark, while White&ndash;bull
sprang into the arena of combat, and in a voice of thunder
shouted to his warriors to stand back and unstring their bows.</p>

<p>During the brief but decisive conflict the appearance of
Wingenund was so much changed, that Ethelston declared to
his friend afterwards that he should not have recognised him.
The muscles of his active frame swelled with exertion, while
the expanded nostril and flashing eye gave to his countenance
an expression of fierce excitement, almost amounting to
ferocity. Now that the struggle was over he resumed, without
an effort, the habitual quiet gentleness of his demeanour,
and turning to Besha, said, “Let the Upsaroka chiefs look
below the belt of that dead wolf; perhaps they will find the
signal whistle of the Kainna.”</p>

<p>The horse&ndash;dealer stooped; and searching, as he was directed,
found a small leathern bag, on opening which there fell out,
as Wingenund had said, the whistle of the Black&ndash;foot chief;
a yell of indignation burst from the assembly, some of the
nearest of whom vented their rage by bestowing sundry kicks
upon the inanimate remains of the treacherous Osage.</p>

<p>Popularity is a plant that springs up as suddenly, and
perishes as rapidly, among the tribes of the Western wilderness,
as among the mobs of Paris or of London; and Wingenund,
whose life would scarcely have been safe had he been found
an hour earlier in the Crow camp, was now its hero and its idol.
To say that the youth was not elated, would be to say that he
was not human; for he had avenged the slaughter of his
kindred, and had overcome the most powerful and renowned
warrior in the Missouri plains, the fell destroyer of the race of
Tamenund. But so well had he been trained in the school of
self&ndash;command, that neither Ethelston, nor Paul Müller who
had known him from his childhood, could trace in his demeanour
anything different from its usual quiet modesty; and they
waited, with no little impatience, to see what results would
ensue from this triumph in respect of their own release.</p>

<p>The Crow chiefs and warriors did not forget, in the excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
of the scene just described, the threatened attack to
which the treachery of Mahéga had exposed them; and they
now crowded round Wingenund, while White&ndash;bull put many
questions to him, through Besha, respecting the position and
apparent numbers of the Black&ndash;feet, to all of which he answered
with a precision that increased the high opinion that
they already entertained of his quickness and intelligence.
White&ndash;bull even condescended so far as to explain to him his
own projects for withdrawing his band from the neighbourhood
of the formidable Kainna to some more secure position.
A slight smile curled the lip of the young Delaware, as he said
to Besha, “The counsel of the Crow chief does not seem good
to Wingenund: if White&ndash;bull will agree to his terms, he will
place the Kainna chief, and half a score of his best warriors,
as captives in this camp before to&ndash;morrow at midday.”</p>

<p>A general murmur of surprise followed these words; and
White&ndash;bull, somewhat nettled, inquired what might be the
terms proposed.</p>

<p>“They are,” said Wingenund, “first, that the two white
prisoners shall be immediately restored to their friends; secondly,
that the Osages shall be given up to the Lenapé;
thirdly, that there shall be peace and friendship between the
friends of Wingenund and the Upsaroka until the snow falls
again upon the earth.”</p>

<p>The leaders having conversed apart for a few minutes,
White&ndash;bull said, “If Wingenund fails, and the Kainna take
many scalps from the Upsaroka, what will happen then?”</p>

<p>“They will take the scalp of Wingenund too,” replied the
youth calmly.</p>

<p>Again the Crow chiefs consulted together for some time, and
at length they resolved to agree to the terms proposed by Wingenund.
The medicine&ndash;pipe was brought, and was passed
from the chief to him, as well as to Ethelston and the missionary;
after which Wingenund said to White&ndash;bull, “There is
no time to be lost; let sixty of the best warriors be chosen,
twenty to go with Wingenund, and forty with White&ndash;bull; and
let one be found, very large and tall; let him put on the dress
of Mahéga; Wingenund will take the whistle, and all will be
ready.”</p>

<p>A short time sufficed to collect and marshal the party; and
Ethelston was, at his own earnest request, permitted to join<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
the band led by the Delaware youth, being anxious to see the
man&oelig;uvres about to take place, and Besha having made himself
responsible for his fidelity.</p>

<p>Wingenund led the way at a swift pace, until he gained the
summit of the first range of hills; nor did he slacken it until
he had crossed the valley beyond, and stood upon the opposite
brow of the heights, whence the Black&ndash;foot band was visible.
Here he concealed and halted his party, until he had crept
forward and examined all the range of hills within sight. As
soon as he had satisfied himself that all was quiet, he drew his
party gently on, and at length succeeded in hiding White&ndash;bull
and his forty men behind some rocks in the steepest and narrowest
part of the gorge leading down to the glen below. His
quick eye had noted the spot before, and a more minute inspection
now convinced him that there was no other pass by
which the enemy could ascend the height, and that a handful
of determined men might defend it against ten times their
number.</p>

<p>Having warned White&ndash;bull to keep his own men close, and
to stir neither hand nor foot until he heard the Lenapé war&ndash;cry,
which was the appointed signal, he retreated with his own
band of twenty men to the point where the interview between
Mahéga and the Black&ndash;foot had taken place, which was about
forty yards higher up the mountain, and where the gorge was
almost as narrow and precipitous as at the pass below. Here
he concealed his men among the rocks, and Ethelston primed
and loaded three rifles, which they had taken from the Osages,
and which were now destined for the use of Wingenund and
himself.</p>

<p>For several weary hours the youth watched in vain for the
approach of the Black&ndash;feet; and any nerves less steady than
his own would have been shaken by the remembrance of the
disagreeable consequences that might result from the failure of
his plot. He lay, however, still and motionless as the stone
upon which his elbow rested, until, just as the grey hue of
evening was beginning to steal over the landscape, he descried
an Indian slowly ascending the steep, followed at a distance
by a long line of warriors. A low whistle from Wingenund
warned his party to be ready, but he moved not until the advancing
band were sufficiently near for him to recognise in
their leader the chief who had conferred with Mahéga on the
preceding day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>While they were approaching in careless security, the Crows
prepared for the attack, each man being provided with a tough
halter of bison&ndash;hide, in addition to his usual weapons of bow,
knife, and war&ndash;club; and the leader of the Black&ndash;feet had
already passed the lower gorge (where White&ndash;bull and his
party were concealed), ere he sounded the signal preconcerted
with Mahéga. Wingenund immediately replied by a similar
sound drawn from the whistle which he had secured, desiring
at the same time the Crow who wore the dress of the slain
Osage to show himself at the edge of the rock skirting the
pass. The Black&ndash;foot chief, completely deceived, toiled lazily
up the steep and narrow ascent, beckoning to his men to
follow; and just as he reached the upper station, Wingenund,
seeing that twelve or fourteen of them were now fairly caged
between the party below and his own, leapt from his concealment
upon the astonished leader of the Black&ndash;feet, and dealing
him a blow on the head that stunned and disabled him, shouted
aloud the war&ndash;cry of the Lenapé.</p>

<p>No sooner was the signal uttered, than White&ndash;bull rushed
from his ambuscade, and seized the pass below; so that the
unfortunate Black&ndash;feet, enclosed between the two parties,
panic&ndash;struck by the suddenness of the attack, and the fall of
their leader, could neither fight nor fly; and in spite of their
desperate but unavailing attempts at resistance, were all in the
course of a few minutes disarmed and securely bound.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the main body of their comrades made a gallant
attempt to force the lower pass, but it was so stoutly defended
by the Crows, and was in itself so narrow and difficult, that
they were soon forced to retire with loss. Neither could those
who succeeded to the command bring them again to the attack.
The war&ndash;cry of the Lenapé had never before been heard in
these glens, and the dismayed Black&ndash;feet thought that the evil
spirits were fighting against them; while to increase their
terror, Ethelston and Wingenund fired two of the rifles over
their heads, the bullets from which whistled past them, and
the echoes of their report, prolonged by the rocks and crags
around, died away at length like the muttered thunder of
a distant storm. Terrified by the suddenness of the attack,
and by the noise of the fire&ndash;arms, ignorant of the number,
position, and even of the nation, of their unexpected assailants,
and fearful that another man&oelig;uvre might cut off their retreat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
they fled precipitately down the mountain&ndash;side, and halted not
until they brought their tale of disgrace and disaster into the
Kainna camp.</p>

<p>In the course of a few hours after the events above narrated,
Wingenund and White&ndash;bull stood together before the lodge of
the aged chief of the Crows, whom the former addressed as
follows:—“My father, see there the Kainna chief, and twelve
of his best warriors; they are prisoners; their life hangs upon
my father’s breath; the promise of Wingenund has not been
blown away by the wind.”</p>

<p>Besha having duly translated this address, was desired by
the old chief (whose astonishment was scarcely exceeded by
his delight) to bestow the highest praise that he could express
upon the young Delaware’s skill and courage; to which
effusion of complimentary eloquence he replied: “My father,
Wingenund has not seen many summers; he has no skill in
speech, nor experience in council; but he knows that the
Great Spirit loves a single tongue, and a true heart. Mahéga
was cunning as a wolf, swift as a deer, strong as a bison&ndash;bull;
but there was poison in his heart, and lies dwelt under his
tongue, like snakes under a smooth stone. What is the end?
The mountain&ndash;buzzards pick his bones; and when his children
ask,—where is the grave of Mahéga? there shall be none to
answer. My father, when the sun has risen, the treaty shall
be made, the pipe of peace shall be smoked, and the Medicine
of the white tent shall bring many good things to the Upsaroka.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, Wingenund retired to the lodge of
Besha; and the captive Black&ndash;feet having been placed under
a guard, White&ndash;bull remained in consultation with his father,
while the other warriors soon forgot in sleep the fatigues of the
past eventful day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">WINGENUND AND HIS FRIENDS RETURN TOWARDS THEIR CAMP.—A
SERIOUS ADVENTURE AND A SERIOUS ARGUMENT OCCUR BY THE
WAY.—SHOWING, ALSO, HOW THE EXTREMES OF GRIEF, SURPRISE,
AND JOY MAY BE CROWDED INTO THE SPACE OF A FEW MINUTES.</p>

<p class="pn">The result of the consultation between White&ndash;bull and his
father was, that the terms of the treaty made with Wingenund
should be strictly observed; but lest the ingenuous reader
should be misled into the belief that this resolution was
influenced by any considerations of good faith or honesty,
it may be as well to inform him that the advantages and
disadvantages of the two opposite courses were discussed with
the most deliberate calculation, and the path of honour was at
length selected upon the following grounds:—</p>

<p><i>First.</i> It was expedient to make friends with the allied
band, inasmuch as the latter were formidable enemies, from
their courage, skill, and equipment.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> They had many bales of cloth, blankets, and
other goods, of which they would probably make liberal presents
to their friends: and,</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> The Crows having just incensed and triumphed
over their hereditary foes the Black&ndash;feet, they might expect
reprisals from the latter; in which event, the alliance of a
band commanding upwards of twenty “medicine&ndash;fire&ndash;weapons,”
was not to be despised.</p>

<p>Having embraced this resolution, and communicated it by
secret messengers to the principal braves and conjurers, the
worthy sire and son summoned them to a grand council on the
following morning, at which the treaty was ratified in due
form; Wingenund, Paul Müller, and Ethelston representing
the allied band, and each party loading the other with praises
and compliments, until the oily tongue of Besha was almost
weary of translating and retranslating their expressions of
mutual amity and fidelity.</p>

<p>The four unhappy survivors of Mahéga’s band were now
brought forward, their arms being securely pinioned behind
them, and Besha inquired of Wingenund his wishes concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
them. It needed only a word from his lips, and they
would have been stabbed, burnt, or more slowly tortured to
death on the spot. The youth looked at them sternly for a
moment, and Paul Müller trembled lest the vengeful instinct
of his race should guide his decision; but he replied, “Wingenund
will take them with him to the Lenapé camp. War&ndash;Eagle,
Netis, and the Black Father shall hold a council, and
what they think best it shall be done.”</p>

<p>Ethelston, Paul Müller, and Wingenund now prepared to
bid adieu to their Crow friends, it having been agreed that
White&ndash;bull, accompanied by some of his principal braves,
should visit the Delaware camp on the following day to interchange
presents, and confirm the alliance thus happily and
unexpectedly commenced; and, as a further proof of his
friendly disposition, the Crow chief permitted Bending&ndash;willow
to send a girdle of delicate fawn&ndash;skin, adorned with feathers
and stained quills, to the “Great Medicine of the white tent.”</p>

<p>Wingenund had still kept possession of the three Osage
rifles, one of which was in the hands of Ethelston; and the
other two he now loaded, and offered one to Paul Müller.</p>

<p>“Nay, my son,” said the missionary, smiling, “these hands
are not skilled in the use of the firelock; neither do they
desire to be acquainted with any weapon more dangerous than
this oaken staff. The shedding of human blood would ill
beseem a humble minister of the Gospel of Peace.”</p>

<p>“The words of the Black Father,” said the youth respectfully,
“are full of goodness and truth; but he must not forget
that the path lies over rough and dangerous places; that there
are four prisoners, who may attempt to overcome or escape
from us, and that we may meet enemies by the way; therefore
Wingenund wished to give the Black Father a weapon to defend
himself.”</p>

<p>“The motive, my son, was natural and blameless; nevertheless,
I purpose to abstain from handling any deadly weapon,
and to entrust my personal safety to Him who has so marvellously
preserved us through trials, captivity, and dangers innumerable.
My children,” continued the worthy man, in the
English tongue, “before we depart hence to revisit our friends,
let us together thank God for the great mercies shown to us;
let us implore his further protection for ourselves and all dear
to us; and let us humbly entreat him, in his own good time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
to soften, turn, and enlighten the hearts of these benighted
children of the wilderness, so that they may hereafter, with
us, be brought to his heavenly kingdom.”</p>

<p>As he said these words, the venerable missionary dropped
upon his knees, Ethelston and Wingenund kneeling beside
him, while he uttered a fervent prayer, which embraced, in
simple, yet eloquent language, all the objects above alluded to.</p>

<p>Great was the surprise of the Crows at the attitude of the
three, and their sudden abstraction from all that was passing
around; but Besha having whispered to the chief that they
were talking to the Great Spirit, he made a signal that profound
silence should be observed, fearful that if they were disturbed,
or anyways annoyed, they would invoke evil upon
himself and his tribe.</p>

<p>The prayer was concluded, and they were about paying their
farewell salutations to the chiefs, when the low wailing of a
female voice from an adjoining lodge caught the missionary’s
ear—an ear to which the accents of distress ever found immediate
entrance. Having desired Besha to inquire into the
cause of her complaint, he learnt that she was the wife of the
man who had been struck down by Mahéga’s war&ndash;club, after
it had grazed the cheek of Wingenund, and that her husband
was now lying in a state of great misery and suffering. In
spite of a gesture of impatience from the Delaware youth,
whose feet burned to be upon the homeward path, the missionary
approached the sufferer, and carefully examined his condition.
He found that the bones of the broken arm had been
joined with tolerable skill and success, and that it was well
secured by bandages to a straight splinter of pine&ndash;wood; but,
whether owing to the roughness of the treatment, or the pain
he had undergone, he was now in a high and dangerous state
of fever. The missionary had still concealed in his girdle a
small bag, containing, among other medicines, a few powders
exactly adapted to the emergency; of these he mixed one with
a little water, and having given it to his patient, left another
with Besha, desiring that it might be administered at noon,
and that no meat should be given to him until the following
day. “With these remedies, and with the blessing of the
Great Spirit,” said he, as he retired, “the man will soon be
well.”</p>

<p>“Did I understand rightly,” said Ethelston to Wingenund,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
“that White&ndash;bull comes over to&ndash;morrow with his braves to
complete the treaty with us, and exchange presents?”</p>

<p>“It is so settled,” replied the youth.</p>

<p>“Would it not then be better to let him and his men bring
with them the Osage prisoners? They are four desperate men,
and only we two are armed; if they mutiny by the way, we
shall be obliged to shoot them in self&ndash;defence.”</p>

<p>“My brother does not know the Washashee and the Upsaroka,”
said Wingenund, smiling; “both of them love the Pale&ndash;faces
and the Lenapé as the wolf loves the deer. No, my
brother, let the prisoners go with us; our eyes must be open;
if they try to run away or do us harm, the rifle must keep
them quiet.”</p>

<p>The youth spoke these words in a low, determined tone; and
Ethelston feeling that he could not gainsay their truth, listened
while Wingenund repeated the warning to the Osages in their own
tongue, informing them that if they made the slightest attempt
to escape, or demonstration of violence by the way, they would
be instantly shot; a sullen and silent inclination of the head,
signifying that he was understood, was the only reply; and
once more greeting their Crow allies, the little party moved off
in the direction of the Delaware camp, Wingenund leading the
way, with a loaded rifle in his hand, the Black&ndash;foot bow and
quiver slung at his back, and a knife and pistol, taken from one
of the Osages, being fastened in his girdle; next came the
four prisoners, with their arms still pinioned, but their legs entirely
at liberty; Paul Müller and Ethelston brought up the
rear; the latter carrying two loaded rifles, one in his hand, and
the other slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful summer morning, the grey mists had
arisen from the valley and curled in spiral folds round the rugged
and precipitous rocks that frowned above it. Short and
scant as was the herbage, still as it glistened in the early dew,
and hung forth its diamond drops in the sun, it imparted a
touch of sweetness to scenery, the dreary barrenness of which
might otherwise have oppressed the mind of the traveller with
a feeling of desolation. Never, perhaps, over that, or over any
other mountain track, passed a lighter foot or a more rejoicing
heart than that of our young friend Wingenund. The dreams
of boyhood, dreams that a few weeks ago he had himself
deemed visionary, or at least remote, were already accomplished;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
he had won the gold spurs of Indian chivalry: in
the dance, or the council, or the field, neither envy nor detraction
could now forbid his mixing with the braves and warriors
of his tribe; and his heart exulted within him as he thought
of presenting to Netis and War&ndash;Eagle the scalp of their arch&ndash;enemy,
the insolent captor of Prairie&ndash;bird, the great warrior of
the Osages, slain by his own hand. These were feelings
which the boy&ndash;hero could share with none, for with Ethelston
he was as yet little acquainted, and Paul Müller he knew to
be averse to all thoughts of strife and conflict; still the feelings
arose unchecked and unrepressed within his bosom when
he remembered the name by which he was called, the deeds of
those who had borne it before him; and mingled with these
memories of the past came the proud reflection, that wherever
the Delaware tongue was yet spoken among the scattered bands
of the Ancient People on the banks of Missouri and Ohio, of
Susquehana and Miami, the song of Lenapé warrior and Lenapé
maiden would tell how the scourge of their tribe, Mahéga, the
Bloody&ndash;hand, had been slain by Wingenund, the brother of
War&ndash;Eagle!</p>

<p>The events of the preceding days had been to the youth the
realised romance of his life; and as he strode along the mountain
side, he felt as if his expanded chest were a world too
narrow for the high emotions that swelled within it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may seem unnatural to the reader, that amidst
all the excitement of awakened hope, ambition, and exultation,
the youth forgot not for a moment the perils by which he was
surrounded. It is our business to describe the Indian character,
not as it might be, if designed “to point a moral or
adorn a tale,” but as it is, with all those lights and shades
which distinguish it from that of white men; and one of the
most remarkable features—one which has also escaped the observation
of those writers who are chiefly quoted as authority
on this subject—is that power of reserved abstraction which
the mind of the Indian acquires as a result of an early and
constant habit of control over the will. Thus, during the
wildest flight of his imagination, and the highest aspirations of
his ambitious hopes, under an excitement which would have
rendered an English youth of his years blind, and deaf, and
careless for the moment of all that was passing around, the
quick eye of Wingenund roved with incessant motion from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
hill to vale, embracing every hollow that might contain an
ambush, and every crag near his path that might give shelter
to a foe.</p>

<p>Ethelston conversed little with the missionary, for there was
a thought which lay close to his heart, and made its pulses
throb more quickly at every step that he made towards the
Delaware camp. Already they were within a few miles of it,
when, in passing a streamlet that flowed across their path,
Wingenund suddenly turned and proposed to his companions
to refresh themselves with a drink.</p>

<p>Passing the Osages, he came back to Ethelston, and said to
him, while the missionary filled a small tin cup with water,
“My brother’s eyes have been shut, let him be ready now;
one of the prisoners is free, and has almost cut the bands of a
second.”</p>

<p>Accustomed to dangers and emergencies, Ethelston did not
start nor take any outward notice of the young Delaware’s
observation; but he replied, “It is true, I have been heedless;
but it is not too late to repair the error: seize him while he is
drinking, I will secure the others; do not take life if it can
be avoided.”</p>

<p>Wingenund took the hint and carried the cup round,
offering a draught to each of the pinioned Osages, without
appearing to notice the severed thong hanging from the wrist
of the one who had freed himself.</p>

<p>Thus thrown off his guard, and thinking he was unsuspected,
the Osage stooped to drink from the cup, when Wingenund
seized him with his left hand, and, presenting a pistol to his
breast, said to him in his own tongue, “If you stir, you die.”</p>

<p>Reckless of consequences, and despairing of mercy in the
Delaware camp, the fierce Osage sprang upon the youth, and
strove to wrench the pistol from his grasp. Being a powerful
man, he might have succeeded in the attempt, had not a blow
from the butt end of Ethelston’s rifle laid him stunned and
prostrate on the ground.</p>

<p>The three other prisoners, seeing their comrade’s helpless
condition, ceased from the violent efforts which they had been
making to free themselves, and by the time that he had
recovered from the effects of the blow, his arms were pinioned
more strongly than before, and the thongs by which the others
were fastened were re&ndash;examined and secured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>While engaged in this operation, Wingenund showed to
Ethelston a sharp flint with which the Osage had cut his own
bands, and had begun to separate those of his next comrade
in the line of march: a few minutes more and his hands
would also have been free, in which case the task of our
two friends would not have proved so easy.</p>

<p>Ethelston well understood Wingenund’s meaning as the
latter showed him the half&ndash;cut thong on the wrist of the
second Indian, and he said, “I confess I was blind, my young
friend, and am ashamed of myself! you will have but a low
opinion of my talents as a warrior.”</p>

<p>“My brother’s eye may have wandered a little,” replied
the youth, smiling, “because he is not skilled in the Washashee
tricks; but his heart is in the right place, and his
hand knows how to strike; a few suns will rise and set before
the skull of that dog forgets what my brother bestowed upon
it.”</p>

<p>“It was time to strike hard, because I did not wish to
strike twice. As I had requested you not to shoot, I felt that
I had made myself answerable for your safety, and if that
second fellow had succeeded in freeing his hands, we might
have had some troublesome work of it. But tell me, Wingenund,
how did you, while walking in front, discover what
was passing behind you?”</p>

<p>“The Osage told me himself,” replied the youth, again
smiling.</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, for assuredly he never spoke.”</p>

<p>“Not with his tongue, but plainly enough with his face.
I looked round once or twice, and my eye met his; I saw
there was mischief, for he looked too good. When I passed
to ask you for the cup, I looked again, quickly, but closer,
and saw that his hands were free, though he kept them
together as before.”</p>

<p>Ethelston could not forbear laughing at the youth’s notion
of the ill&ndash;favoured Osage, “looking too good;” but feeling both
amused and interested by his replies, he again said, “I must
own my admiration of your quick&ndash;sightedness, for doubtless
the Osage tried to make the expression of his face deceive
you.</p>

<p>“He has not the face of an Indian warrior,” said the
youth, scornfully. “When a deed is to be done or concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
let my brother try and read it in the face of War&ndash;Eagle, or
any great chief of the Lenapé! As well might he strive to
count the stones in the deepest channel of the great Muddy
River,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> or the stars of heaven in a cloudy night!”</p>

<p>The party had now struck a broad trail, leading across the
valley, and up the opposite height, in the direction of the
Delaware camp; the Osage prisoners were therefore sent to
the front, and ordered to march forward on the trail by
which means Wingenund enjoyed the advantage of watching
their movements, while he continued to converse with his
friends.</p>

<p>“I own,” said Ethelston, “that I had not before considered
a command over the muscles of the countenance as being a
matter of so much importance in the character of an Indian
warrior.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless the youth is right in what he says,” replied
Paul Müller. “Where cunning and artifice are so often
resorted to, a natural and unconcerned air of candour is an
admirable shield of defence: the quickness of sight which you
lately observed in Wingenund, is an hereditary quality in his
race. The grandfather of Tamenund was so celebrated for it,
that he was called by a name signifying ‘The man who has
eyes in his back:’ he was killed only twenty years ago,
during the fierce irruption made by a band of the five nations
into the valley of Wyoming, to which the old man had retired
in the hope of closing his eyes in peace.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of that tragedy,” said Ethelston; “indeed,
it occurred while I was at school on the banks of the Muskingum;
and often as the boys went or returned, they used to
frighten each other with cries of ‘The Indians!’ but I have
since been much absent from my own country, and never
rightly understood who were the actors in that scene of terror,
and what were the tribes usually known by the name of the
Six Nations, for so I have always heard them called.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span></p>

<p>“There were in fact only five,” replied the missionary;
“for although the Tuscaroras joined the confederation, they
did not originally belong to it. These five are known among
white men by the following names:—The Mohawks, Oneidas,
Cayugas, Onondagas, and Senecas; and it was a band of the
latter that made the irruption into the valley of Wyoming. I
dare say that Wingenund knows more of them than I do, for
he often heard Tamenund speak of them, and he knew their
history like the traditions of his own tribe.”</p>

<p>“Wingenund has not forgotten,” replied the youth, “what
his grandfather taught him concerning the Five Nations. The
names spoken by the Black Father are those commonly given
them; but they call themselves otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Wingenund,” said Ethelston, “the names by
which they are known among themselves?”</p>

<p>“The Mohawks are called Coningionah. The Oneidas,
Oni&ndash;eut&ndash;kah; or ‘The people of the standing&ndash;stone.’ The
Cayugas, Senanda Wanandu&ndash;nah; ‘The people of the great
pipe.’ The Onondagas, Nundagekah; ‘People of the small
hill.’ The Senecas, Nundawâ&ndash;gah; ‘People of the big hill.’
But the council name of the last is different.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by the council name?”</p>

<p>“Many of the nations have more than one name, and the
council name is never spoken except by the chiefs and wise
men in council; the women and boys seldom know it; and if
they do, they must not speak it.”</p>

<p>“Did Tamenund tell you the council name of the Senecas?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is Oni&ndash;hoout, ‘Those who shut the door;’ because
the Senecas live the furthest to the south&ndash;west, and guard the
others from the approach of their enemies.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>“It always appeared to me,” said Ethelston, turning to the
missionary, “that the variety and arbitrary alteration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
Indian names present an insuperable barrier in the way of any
inquiry into their national or local history.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my son; the difficulty is great, and proceeds
from various causes:—First, because it is frequently, perhaps
generally, the case among Indian nations, that the son takes
the name of the mother, and not, as with us, that of the
father. Secondly, there often are, as you have just learnt
from Wingenund, two or three names by which the same
person or tribe is designated. Thirdly, nothing is more
common than for a warrior to receive a new name from any
daring or remarkable feat that he may have performed, in
which case his former name is dropped, and soon forgotten:
and, lastly, it must be remembered, that we, American, Germans,
and English, have obtained the greater part of our
Indian nomenclature, both as to persons and places, from the
French; who, in the various capacities of possessors, adventurers,
missionaries, voyageurs, hunters, and interpreters, have
overrun almost the whole of this continent before us.”</p>

<p>“It is, then, your opinion that the French travellers and
writers from whom these names have been chiefly derived,
have been very careless and inaccurate in their transcription of
them?”</p>

<p>“Extremely so. When they first reached and descended
the Mississippi, they called it the ‘Colbert;’ afterwards, on
finding what a magnificent river it became when it received
the waters of the Missouri, they call it ‘La rivière St.
Louis,’ by which name it was known for many years, until
insensibly it recovered its Indian appellation. When the adventurers
came to any unknown tribe, they called them by some
name descriptive of the accidental circumstances under which
they first saw them, and these names they have ever since
retained. Thus, the Winnebagoes in the north happened,
when first visited, to be drying fish in their camp, and thence
obtained the pleasant name by which they are now known,
‘Les Puans!’ Another band, some of whom had accidentally
been scorched, by the prairie and underwood near their
encampment taking fire, have ever since been called ‘Les
Bois&ndash;Brulés;’ another, ‘Les Gros Ventres.’<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The Dahcotah
nation they have called ‘Les Sioux;’ the Aricará, ‘Les Ris;’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
and so forth, until it is difficult, if not impossible, to recognise
any of the original Indian names under their French disguise.”</p>

<p>“I grant this,” said Ethelston. “Yet we must not forget
that the English have in several instances laid themselves open
to the same charge; otherwise the great nation to which our
young friend belongs would not have been called after a Norman
baron! But you will surely allow that the early French
missionaries in North America were men of great piety, learning,
and enterprise?”</p>

<p>“It is true, my son, many of them were so; and none can
feel more grateful than I do to such of them as laboured sincerely
in the service of the Gospel. Yet I am bound to say,
that in the best authorised account which they sent to France
from Natchez of the surrounding country,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> there is so much
pedantry, prejudice, and fancy, mingled with highly interesting
information, that the book cannot be quoted as one possessing
historical authority. A writer who gravely infers that the
Mississippi Indians came from the north&ndash;eastern straits, from
the identity of the Choctaws with the people of Kamchâktâ
(or Royaume des Chactas), must expect that some of his other
arguments and speculations should be received with diffidence.—But
see, we have reached the summit of this range, and
Wingenund’s sparkling eye is already fixed upon the tent of
Prairie&ndash;bird.”</p>

<p>“There it is!” said the youth; “they have moved it since
I came away, and placed it on that point nearer the stream.”</p>

<p>Little did he suspect what had occurred during his brief
absence, as, with a foot light and elastic as his heart, he put
himself at the head of his little party, and led the way swiftly
towards the camp.</p>

<p>As the party drew near the camp they fell in with the outpiquet
on guard in that quarter, consisting of one of the
Delaware braves and two of his men, to whom Wingenund
entrusted his Osage prisoners, adding, “Give them water and
food, but let them not escape.”</p>

<p>The brave looked full in the face of the youth, then his
eye roved from the scalp at his belt to the pinioned Osages,
and a grim smile played across his features; but they almost
instantly relapsed into the grave and gloomy expression that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
they had before worn; not another word was spoken, and the
three passed on towards the white tent. As they drew near,
they saw a group of hunters, among whom were Pierre and
Bearskin, sitting round a smouldering fire, some smoking, and
others engaged in mending their mocassins or cleaning their
pistols and rifles. There was neither joke nor song amongst
them; and although they started up to welcome their rescued
and returning friends, the latter perceived that something was
wrong, and it was with aching and foreboding hearts that they
returned the friendly greeting, and passed onwards towards the
tent, before which they saw Reginald and Baptiste in earnest
conversation.</p>

<p>Reginald no sooner saw them, than he sprung forward to
embrace Ethelston, exclaiming, “God be praised for this great
and unexpected comfort!”</p>

<p>Ethelston looked in his friend’s face; and its expression
confirming his apprehensions, his lip grew pale and trembled;
he gasped for breath, as, pressing Reginald’s hand within his
own, he said, “Speak—speak! tell me what has happened?”
then pointing to the tent, he added, “Is she safe?—is she
well?”</p>

<p>“She is safe—she is well!” replied Reginald; “nevertheless—“</p>

<p>Ethelston heard no more, but a deep groan relieved the
oppression of his heart, as he ejaculated, “Blessed be the
God of Mercies!” and covering his face with his hands, stood
for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>Reginald was surprised at this extraordinary emotion in his
friend, usually so composed and calm, and at the deep interest
that he took in one whom, although betrothed to his intended
brother&ndash;in&ndash;law, he had not yet seen. But he added, gravely,
“God knows, my dear friend, that my gratitude is not less
fervent than yours. Precious as her life is, it has however
been ransomed at a price dearer to me than aught else on earth
besides herself. Wingenund,” he continued, addressing the
youth, and affectionately taking his hand, “you are the son of
a race of heroes; is your heart firm? are you prepared to
suffer the griefs that the Great Spirit thinks fit to send?”</p>

<p>They youth raised his dark eyes to the speaker’s face; and
subduing by a powerful effort the prescient agony of his soul,
he said in a low tone, “Let Netis speak on; the ears of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
Wingenund are ready to hear what the Great Spirit has
sent.”</p>

<p>“Dear Wingenund, alas! War&ndash;Eagle, our beloved brother
is—“</p>

<p>“Dead!” interrupted the youth, letting the butt of his rifle
fall heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>“Nay, not yet dead, perhaps worse than dead; for he is
hurt beyond all hope of cure, yet suffers torture such as none
but himself could endure without complaint.”</p>

<p>It was fearful for those who stood by to witness the agonising
struggle of emotions that convulsed the frame of the young
Delaware on receiving this announcement; for War&ndash;Eagle had
been to him not only a brother, but father, companion, and
friend, the object on whom all the affections of his young
heart had been concentrated with an intensity almost idolatrous!
Yet even in the extremity of anguish he forgot not the
rude yet high philosophy of his race and nurture; he could
not bear that any human eye should witness his weakness, or
that any white man should be able to say that Wingenund,
the last of the race of Tamenund, had succumbed to suffering.
Terrible was the internal conflict; and while it was yet uncertain
how it might end, his hand accidentally rested upon
his belt, and his fingers closed upon the scalp of Mahéga;
instantly, as if by magic, the grief of the loving brother was
crushed by the stoic pride of the Indian warrior.</p>

<p>“War&ndash;Eagle is not dead; his eyes shall look upon the
scalp of his great enemy slain by the hand which he first
taught to use a bow; and when he goes to the hunting&ndash;fields
of the brave, our fathers may ask him, ‘Where is the scalp
of the destroyer of our race?’” Such were the thoughts that
shot like wildfire through the brain and through the breast of
the young Delaware, as with a countenance almost haughty in
its expression, he drew up his graceful form to its full height,
saying, “Where is War&ndash;Eagle? Wingenund would see him.
Let the Black Father go too; perhaps his healing skill might
avail.”</p>

<p>“I will not deceive you, dear Wingenund; no human skill
can avail our departing friend. He is now within the tent;
Prairie&ndash;bird watched with him all the night; she spoke to him
often words from God’s own book, and they seemed to comfort
him, for he smiled, and said he would gladly hear more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
She has retired to take a few hours’ sleep, then she will return
and resume her sad but endearing task.”</p>

<p>“Wingenund will go to him; but first let Netis say whence
the wounds of War&ndash;Eagle came. Have enemies been near the
camp?”</p>

<p>With the eloquence of deep feeling Reginald briefly related
the circumstances attending War&ndash;Eagle’s devoted and heroic
defence of Prairie&ndash;bird from the bears.</p>

<p>Ethelston and Paul Müller listened with suspended breath,
and as he concluded exclaimed together, “Noble, brave, and
generous War&ndash;Eagle!” while the youth, pressing his lips
together as if steeling his breast against softer impressions,
said in a low tone, “‘Twas well done; few are the warriors
whose single knife has reached the heart of a grisly bear. Let
us go on to the tent.”</p>

<p>Reginald led the way, and, lifting the flap, entered, followed
by Ethelston, Wingenund, and Paul Müller.</p>

<p>The chief was seated in the centre, propped by bales of
cloth and fur; his sunken eye was closed from sleeplessness
and exhaustion, and a blanket loosely thrown over his
shoulders, covered the emaciated remains of his once powerful
and athletic frame. At his side lay his favourite pipe, his
war&ndash;club, knife, and rifle; while the faithful Lita, stretched
at his feet, strove in vain to restore their natural warmth, by
applying to them hot stones enveloped in the shreds of a blanket,
which she had torn up for the purpose. The entrance of the
party was not unmarked by the wounded chief, and a smile
passed over his wasted features when he unclosed his eyes,
and recognised Wingenund and the two others whom he had
rescued from the Crows.</p>

<p>“The Black Father is welcome,” he said, in a faint, but
cheerful voice, “and so is the friend of Netis; and War&ndash;Eagle
is glad to see the face of his brother Wingenund.”</p>

<p>We have seen how the youth had, by a desperate effort,
nerved himself to bear, without giving way, the description of
his brother’s wounds and hopeless condition; yet when the
feeble tones of that loved voice thrilled upon his ear, when his
eye fell upon the wasted frame, and when he saw written
upon that noble countenance proofs not to be mistaken, of
torture endured, and death approaching, the string which had
refused to be relaxed started asunder, and he fell senseless to
the ground, while a stream of blood gushed from his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span></p>

<p>Half&ndash;raising himself by the aid of his yet unwounded arm,
War&ndash;Eagle made a vain effort to move towards his young
brother, and his eye shone with something of its former eager
lustre, as he said, in a voice louder than he was deemed
capable of uttering, “Let the Black Father lend his aid and
skill to the youth; he is the last leaf on the Unâmi branch;
dear is his blood to the Lenapé.”</p>

<p>“Dearer to none than to me,” said the missionary, raising
and supporting the unconscious youth, “for to him I owe
my liberty, perhaps my life. ’Tis only the rupture of a small
blood&ndash;vessel; fear not for him, my brave friend, he will soon
be better.”</p>

<p>While Paul Müller, assisted by one of the Delawares who
stood at the entrance of the tent, carried the youth into the
open air, and employed the restoratives which his experience
suggested, the chief mused upon the words which he had last
heard, and inquired, addressing himself to Reginald, “What
said the Black Father of his life and liberty being given by
Wingenund?”</p>

<p>“Tell the chief, Ethelston, what has befallen, and how you
and Paul Müller were rescued by Wingenund. In my deep
anxiety for my suffering friend, I was satisfied with seeing
that you had returned in safety, and never inquired how you
escaped.”</p>

<p>Ethelston drew near to the wounded chief, so that he might
distinctly hear every syllable spoken, and said, “War&ndash;Eagle,
as surely as Prairie&ndash;bird owes her life and safety to your
devoted courage, so surely do the Father and I owe our lives
and liberty to that of Wingenund. Can you listen now, and
follow me while I tell you all that has happened?”</p>

<p>The chief gave a silent nod of assent, and Ethelston proceeded
in the simple language of true feeling, to relate to him
the events recorded in the last chapter. At the commencement
of the narrative, the chief, expecting, probably, that the escape
had been effected by some successful disguise or stratagem,
closed his eyes, as if oppressed by the torturing pains that
shot through his frame; but he opened them with awakened
interest, when the scene of the council was described, and at
the mention of Mahéga’s name, he ejaculated “Ha!”—his
countenance assumed a fierce expression, and his hand unconsciously
grasped the war&ndash;club that lay beside him.</p>

<p>Reginald listened with deep interest, and even Lita, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
hitherto appeared insensible to every thing except the sufferings
of her beloved lord, threw back the long hair from her
eyes, marvelling what this might be that so excited and revived
him; but when Ethelston related the catastrophe, how Mahéga
had thrown his club, slightly grazing the youth, and how the
latter had, in presence of the assembled Crows, killed and
scalped the great Osage, the breast of the Delaware warrior
heaved with proud emotions, which quelled for the moment all
sense of the pains that racked his frame: his eye lightened
with the fire of other days, and waving the war&ndash;club over his
head, he shouted, for the last time, the war&ndash;cry of his tribe.</p>

<p>As the chief fell back exhausted upon his rude pillow, the
gentle voice of Prairie&ndash;bird was heard from the adjoining compartment
of the tent, calling Lita to explain the meaning of
the loud and unexpected cry by which she had been aroused
from her slumber. Lita withdrew; and while her mistress
made her rapid and simple toilet, informed her of the safe
return of the Black Father and Wingenund, and that the latter
having been seized with a sudden illness, the friend of Reginald
had remained by the chief, and had communicated some
intelligence, which seemed to affect him with the most extravagant
joy and excitement.</p>

<p>So anxious was the maiden to see her beloved preceptor, and
so hastily did she fold the kerchief in the form of a turban
round her head, that several of her dark tresses escaped from
beneath it, and fell over her neck. The first dress that came
to her hand was one made from a deep&ndash;blue Mexican shawl,
of ample dimension, given to her by the missionary. Fastening
this round her slender waist with an Indian girdle, and a
pair of mocassins upon her delicate feet, she went forth,
catching up as she left the tent a scarf, which she threw carelessly
over her shoulders. Greeting War&ndash;Eagle hastily, but
affectionately, as she passed, she flew with a glowing cheek
and beating heart to the spot where the missionary still bent
with anxious solicitude over the reviving form of Wingenund.</p>

<p>“My father—my dear father!” she exclaimed, seizing
his hand; “God be praised for thy safe return!”</p>

<p>The venerable man embraced her tenderly, and after contemplating
for a moment her countenance beaming with filial
affection, he placed his outspread hands upon her head, saying,
with impressive solemnity, “May the blessing of God rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
upon thee, my beloved child, and upon all near and dear to
thee, for ever!”</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird bowed her head meekly while breathing a silent
amen to the holy man’s benediction, and then turned to inquire
of her young brother how he now felt, and of Paul
Müller into the cause of his sudden illness.</p>

<p>Wingenund was sufficiently recovered to speak to her gratefully
in reply, and to press the hand which she held out to
him; but he was much reduced by loss of blood, and the
missionary, putting his finger to his lips, enjoined him quiet
and silence for the present. He continued, however, in a low
voice to explain to her the strange events that had lately
occurred, and how he and the friend of her betrothed owed
to the heroism of Wingenund their life and liberty.</p>

<p>While the maiden listened with absorbed attention, every
passage in the brief but eventful tale was legible on her eloquent
countenance. As Reginald stood at a little distance
gazing earnestly upon its changeful loveliness, he was startled
by a suppressed ejaculation from some one at his side, at the
same time that his arm was seized and pressed with almost
convulsive force. He turned, and saw his friend Ethelston,
who, finding that War&ndash;Eagle had fallen into a tranquil sleep
had stolen out of the tent to the side of Reginald, where he
first caught a sight of the maiden as she listened to the missionary’s
narrative. Reginald again observed with astonishment
that his friend, usually so calm, trembled from head to
foot: his eye rested upon the group with a preternatural fixedness,
and his lips moved inaudibly, like those of a man scarcely
recovered from a trance. “Gracious Heaven! what can have
happened? Edward, <i>you</i> are not surely ill! that would indeed
fill the cup of our trials to the brim. Speak to me! let me
hear your voice, for your looks alarm me!”</p>

<p>Ethelston made no reply, but he pointed with his finger
towards Prairie&ndash;bird, and two or three large tear&ndash;drops rolled
down his cheeks.</p>

<p>While this was passing, Paul Müller had brought his tale
to a conclusion, and his eye happening to light upon Ethelston,
he continued (still addressing Prairie&ndash;bird), “And now, my
dear child, it only remains for me to tell you the cause of our
beloved young brother’s weakened condition. The extremes
of joy and of anguish will sometimes sweep before them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
mightiest bulwarks that can be raised in the heart of man by
his own unaided strength. Wingenund opposed to the stroke
of affliction sent from on high not the meek, trusting endurance
of Christian resignation, but the haughty resistance of human
pride. Already he sees and repents his error, and the mist is
clearing away from his eyes; but you, my dear child, have
been better taught; you have learnt, in all trials and in all
emergencies, to throw yourself upon the mercy of your heavenly
Father, and to place your whole trust in his gracious promises
of protection. We are more apt to forget this duty when our
cup overflows with joy than when his chastening hand is upon
us; but it should not be so. Promise me, then, promise me,
my beloved child, that in weal or in woe, in the rapture of joy
as in the extremity of sorrow, you will strive to remember and
practise it.”</p>

<p>Awed by the unusual solemnity of his manner, the maiden
bowed her head, and said, “I promise.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had she said these words, when Reginald came
forward, leading his friend Ethelston, who had by a strong
effort recovered from his extreme agitation, and regained something
of his usual composure. “Prairie&ndash;bird,” said Reginald,
“I wish to make known to you, my most faithful companion,
my tried and attached friend Ethelston. You must love him
now for my sake; when you know him, you will do so for his
own.”</p>

<p>Leaning on the missionary’s arm, the maiden raised herself
from her stooping posture to greet the friend of her betrothed.
“I have heard much——,” she said, with her sweet natural
dignity of manner; but she suddenly stopped, starting as if
she had seen a ghost, and clinging closer to Paul Müller’s arm,
while her earnest gaze encountered the eyes of Ethelston fixed
upon her with an expression that seemed to shake the nerves
and fibres of her heart. To Reginald their silence and agitation
was an incomprehensible mystery: not so to the missionary,
who still supported Prairie&ndash;bird, and whispered to her as she
advanced a step nearer to the stranger, “Your promise.” She
understood him, for he heard her breathe the Almighty’s name,
as Ethelston also advanced a step towards her; and again their
looks dwelt upon each other with a fixed intensity that spoke
of thoughts too crowded, and confused, and mysterious, for
expression. At length Ethelston, whose strong and wellbalanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
mind had triumphed over the first shock of emotion,
addressed the maiden, saying, “Have the latter years been so
happily spent that they have quite banished from the mind of
Prairie&ndash;bird the memory of early days?”</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the maiden started, as if she had
received an electric shock; her bosom heaved with agitation,
and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>Again the missionary whispered, “Your promise!” while
Ethelston continued, “Has she forgotten her own little garden
with the sun&ndash;dial? and poor Mary, who nursed, and dressed,
and taught her to read? Has she forgotten the great Bible full
of prints, of which she was so fond; and the green lane that
led to Mooshanne? Has Evy forgotten her Edward?”</p>

<p>“’Tis he—’tis he! ’tis Eddy! my own, my long&ndash;lost
brother!” cried the maiden aloud, as she threw herself into
his arms; and looking up into his face, she felt his cheek as if
to assure herself that all was not a dream, and poured out her
grateful heart in tears upon his bosom. She did remember
her promise, and even in the first tumult of her happiness,
she sought and derived from him to whom she owed it, strength
to endure its sudden and overwhelming excess.</p>

<p>“’Tis even so,” said the missionary, grasping the astonished
Reginald’s arm; “for some time I had suspected that such was
the case; Prairie&ndash;bird, my beloved pupil, and your betrothed
bride, is no other than Evelyn Ethelston, the sister of your
friend. My suspicions were confirmed and almost reduced to
certainty, during the first conversations that I held with him
in St. Louis; for he, being several years older than you, remembered
many of the circumstances attending the disappearance
and supposed destruction of his little sister by the Indians,
when his father’s house was ravaged and burnt. I foresaw
that they must meet when he left the settlements in search of
you, and though I prepared him for the interview, I thought
it better to say nothing to her or to you, but to leave the recognition
to the powerful voice of Nature. You see the result in
that fraternal embrace, and I have in a little bag, given to me
by Tamenund when at the point of death, proofs of her identity
that would convince a sceptic, were you disposed to be
one—the cover of a child’s spelling&ndash;book, in which her name
is written at length (possibly by Ethelston), and a little kerchief,
with the initials E. E. in the corner, both of which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
in her hand when she was carried off by the Indian who spared
and preserved her!”</p>

<p>While the missionary felt beneath the folds of his dark serge
robe for the bag which he had always carefully kept suspended
by a ribbon from his neck, Reginald’s memory was busy in
recalling a thousand indistinct recollections of early days, and
in comparing them with those of a more recent date.</p>

<p>“Well do I remember,” he exclaimed, “missing my sweet
little playmate in childhood; and how all allusion to the terrible
calamity that befel our nearest neighbour and friend, was
forbid in our family! Scarcely ever, even in later years, have
I touched upon the subject with Ethelston, for I saw that it
gave him pain, and brought a cloud over his brow. Now, I
can understand the wild and troubled expression that came
across her countenance when she first saw me near the Osage
camp, and first heard my voice, and how she started, and
afterwards recovered herself, when I told her of Mooshanne!
How blind have I now been to every thing save her endearing
qualities, and the ten thousand graces that wait upon her angelic
form! See how like they are, now that a tide of feeling
is poured into the countenance of my steady and composed
friend. Jealous as I am of her time, and of every grain of
her affection, I must not grudge them a few minutes of undisturbed
intercourse after a separation of so many years! Come,
worthy Father, let us employ ourselves in tending and ministering
to War&ndash;Eagle and Wingenund, and let us not forget
that to them, next to Heaven, we are indebted for the life and
happiness of every single member of our miraculously reunited
circle.”</p>

<p>“You have a warm and a kindly heart, my young friend,”
said the missionary, “and that is a blessing without which all
the other blessings of Heaven may fall like showers upon the
Lybian desert. I know how you must long to pour out your
feelings of affection on this occasion to your friend, and to
your betrothed; but believe me, you will not have done amiss
by following the first promptings of your heart. Let us, as
you propose, endeavour to soothe and comfort the sufferers;
Wingenund is now sufficiently recovered to listen while you
relate to him these strange occurrences; only caution him not
to speak too much at present. I will return to the side of
War&ndash;Eagle, and although it be too late now for us to attempt
any remedy for his bodily pains, who shall limit the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
the Almighty, or circumscribe the operation of his hands?
Who knows whether He may not think fit, even at the eleventh
hour, to touch that stern and obdurate heart with a coal from
His altar? And, oh! my dear young friend, if such be His
blessed purpose, I would not forego the privilege of being the
humble instrument in effecting it for all the wealth, the
honours, the happiness, that earth can bestow.”</p>

<p>Reginald looked after the worthy missionary until he disappeared
within the tent, then sighing heavily, he said to
himself, “If zeal, honesty, and true piety can render any
human means available, assuredly that excellent and holy
man’s attempt will not be made in vain; and yet I fear that
nothing short of a miracle can soften or subdue the stern pride
of War&ndash;Eagle’s spirit. How deeply anxious do I feel for the
issue! for I cannot forget that it was in defence of Prairie&ndash;bird
that he incurred this fearful torture, ending in an untimely
death! His life sacrificed that mine might be happy
with her! Where, where, my generous Indian brother, shall
I find, among the cities and crowded haunts of civilized man,
truth, self&ndash;denial, and devoted affection like thine? At least
I will strive to fulfil the wish that I know to be nearest thy
heart, by cherishing in my bosom’s core thy beloved brother
Wingenund!”</p>

<p>Thus meditating, Reginald sat down by the young Delaware,
and strove, by awakening his interest in the strange
events lately brought to light respecting Prairie&ndash;bird, to wean
him from the deep dejection caused by his brother’s hopeless
plight.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">CONTAINING A TREATY BETWEEN THE CROWS AND DELAWARES,
AND THE DEATH OF AN INDIAN CHIEF.</p>

<p class="pn">It is unnecessary to describe at length the occupations of
the party during the remainder of this eventful day; how
the reunited brother and sister called up a thousand long&ndash;stored,
endearing remembrances; how they looked upon the
childish relics preserved by the missionary, and how, after
interchanging a rapid but interesting sketch of each other’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
history, they turned again to share with him and with Reginald
the melancholy and affecting duty of attending upon
the dying chieftain. His sufferings were now less acute,
but mortification had extended itself rapidly, and threatened
hourly to terminate them altogether, by seizing upon the vitals.
His mind seemed tranquil and collected as ever, only the
watchful missionary, observing that he listened more attentively
to the voice of Prairie&ndash;bird than to any other, he yielded his
place beside the dying man to her, entreating her to spare no
efforts that might lead him, by the appointed path, to the
Fountain of Mercy.</p>

<p>Willingly did the maiden resume the task on which she had
been employed during the greater part of the preceding night;
and after praying fervently for a blessing on her labours, she
proceeded to explain to him again, in his own language, some
of the simplest and most affecting truths of the Gospel dispensation.</p>

<p>What an interesting spectacle for the contemplation of a
Christian philosopher! A heathen warrior, whose youth had
been nurtured with tales of fierce reprisal and revenge, whose
path in life had been marked with blood, war being at once
his pleasure and his pride, stretched now upon the ground,
still in the prime of manhood, yet with shortening breath and
ebbing strength listening with deep attention to the words of
hope and consolation pronounced by the lips of her who had
been, through life, the secretly treasured idol of his heart!
Perhaps this earthly love, purified as it had long been from passion
and ennobled by the sacrifice that he had made to friendship,
was the channel through which the mysterious influences
of the Divine Spirit were appointed to flow; for his eager ear
lost not a word of what she uttered, and his heart was softened
to receive from her lips, truths against which, if delivered by
another, its early prejudices might have rebelled.</p>

<p>Partly by the religious creed of his race, and partly by
former conversation with herself and the missionary, he was
already impressed with a just view of the principal attributes
of Deity,—His omnipotence, goodness, and eternity. The
chief endeavour of Prairie&ndash;bird was now to convince him that
the God of the Christians addressed the same word, the same
promises and invitations to the Indians as to them, and that
they also were included in the vast and mysterious scheme of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
redemption; for this purpose she translated for him, into the
Delaware tongue, some of those magnificent passages in
Isaiah wherein the Almighty, after declaring his unity and
irresistible power, sends forth his gracious promises to the
uttermost parts of the earth, to the isles, to the wilderness, to
the inhabitants of the mountains, and those that dwell among
the rocks, and concludes with the assurance, “I will bring the
blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths
that they have not known. I will make darkness light before
them, and crooked things straight; these things will I do unto
them, and not forsake them.”</p>

<p>War&ndash;Eagle listened attentively, and gave the whole strength
of his mind to the consideration of the subject propounded!
Some of these truths he had heard before, but they had taken
no fixed root, and had rather been dismissed unheeded, than
weighed and rejected. Now they presented themselves under
a very different aspect; for they were pressed upon him with
the most affectionate earnestness by the one whom he looked
up to as the most gifted and the most guileless of human
beings; and the Black Father also, for whom he entertained
the highest esteem and regard, and told him repeatedly that
every truth, every thing necessary for happiness after death,
was written in that book from which she was now reading;
that it was, in short, the written command of Him whom he
had from his youth addressed as the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>Deeply moved by these reflections (aided as they may perhaps
have been by the operations of a mightier influence), the
chief propounded to his young instructress several inquiries,
which it rejoiced her to hear, as they indicated a softened and
teachable spirit. Neither were they difficult for her to answer,
as she was familiar with almost every page of the volume
before her, and thus knew where to seek at once a solution of
every doubt and difficulty that occurred to her simple&ndash;minded
and ingenuous patient.</p>

<p>While she was engaged in this interesting and truly Christian
task, Reginald, Ethelston, and the missionary sate with
Wingenund, and strove to soothe and tranquillise the agitation
into which the late disaster had thrown him. Although somewhat
weakened by loss of blood, he had recovered his faculties,
both of body and mind; but all the well&ndash;meant endeavours
of his friends to raise him from the deep depression of spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
into which he had fallen were exerted in vain. He replied
gently, and without petulance, to various questions that they
put to him, and then sank again into desponding gloom,
musing over the fading fortunes of his family and of his
tribe,—now about to lose him who was the pride, the support,
and the glory of both.</p>

<p>After several unsuccessful attempts, Ethelston touched at
length upon a topic which had in some degree the effect of
arresting his attention and engaging the more active powers of
his mind; for on reminding the youth that the Crows were to
visit the camp on the morrow, to interchange presents and
conclude the treaty of peace, Wingenund proposed to Reginald
that he should summon Baptiste and Pierre, and concert, with
their advice, the course that it might be advisable to pursue.</p>

<p>While they were employed in considering and discussing
deliberately the various plans proposed, Paul Müller and
Prairie&ndash;bird continued, sometimes together, and sometimes
alternately, their attendance upon War&ndash;Eagle, whose strength
was rapidly declining, although his intellect remained clear and
unimpaired. Food he was unable to taste; but the grateful
smile with which he received now and then a cup of water
from the hand of Prairie&ndash;bird touched her sensibly; and there
was a serene composure upon his countenance, which encouraged
her to hope that his mind was in a peaceful frame,
and that thoughts of war and strife were gradually giving
place to better and holier meditations.</p>

<p>The sun went down, evening fell, and the darkening hours
of night found the maiden still unwearied at her post, seizing,
with instinctive tact, every opportunity offered by his inquiries
or remarks for quoting to him from the Book of Life some
appropriate and consoling truth; nor did she retire to rest
until she felt assured that exhausted nature had extended the
boon of slumber to her suffering patient.</p>

<p>Not even then did the faithful Lita quit the place that she
had chosen at the feet of the warrior whom she had so long
worshipped in secret; noticed or unnoticed, thanked or unthanked,
whether hungry, or thirsty, or sleepless, all was the
same to her. In life her love had been either unknown or
despised; and now the last faint glimmerings of hope were to
be extinguished, without even the wretched consolation of pity.
During the watches of that night there were tears upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
pillow of Prairie&ndash;bird; the eyes of Wingenund were sleepless,
and his heart loaded with sorrow. Sharp and frequent were
the pangs and shooting&ndash;pains that broke the rest of the departing
chief; yet was there, perhaps, none amongst them all
whose sufferings were not light in comparison with the silent
and hopeless anguish of the Comanche girl.</p>

<p>The morning dawned with all the fresh beauty of summer
in that mountain region; and, agreeably to the resolution
formed at the council held on the preceding evening, the whole
party was summoned to parade with their best arms and accoutrements,
so as to produce upon the Indians a due impression
of their formidable strength; at the same time that various
bales were unpacked, from which were selected the presents
intended for the principal chiefs and braves.</p>

<p>No great change had taken place in the state of War&ndash;Eagle,
but Wingenund had spent an hour with him alone; during
which, among other subjects of greater importance, he had
mentioned the expected visit of the Crows, and the conditions
of the treaty which it was proposed to make with them. To
these the chief had given his assent, and had deputed his
young brother to act in his stead; after which he turned again
with renewed eagerness and anxiety to the subjects suggested
to him by Prairie&ndash;bird and the missionary.</p>

<p>The sun was not very high in the heaven, when the band of
Crows were seen descending the hill towards the encampment.
They were led by White&ndash;bull, accompanied by Besha, and
were only twelve in number, all magnificently clad in dresses
of deer&ndash;skin, ornamented with coloured feathers, stained quills,
scalp&ndash;locks, and the other adjuncts of Crow chivalry. Besha
apologised for the scantiness of the deputation, stating, that
during the past night an attempt had been made by the Black&ndash;feet
to rescue their prisoners; and although it had not been
successful, the Crows could not venture, in the neighbourhood
of such dangerous foes, to weaken the defence of their camp,
by sending away a large body of its best warriors. To this a
suitable and complimentary reply having been made, the
business of the day commenced by presenting food to the
Upsaroka guests.</p>

<p>A circle having been made, the white hunters were ranged
on one side of it, and the Delawares on the other: the former,
being all armed with rifles, and pistols, and hunting&ndash;knives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
presented a very warlike appearance; while the sinewy and
weather&ndash;beaten frames of the latter, armed as they were with
rifle, war&ndash;club, and scalp&ndash;knife, inspired the observant leader
of the Crows with no wish to bring his band into hostile
collision with such a party. In the centre were seated Reginald
Brandon, Wingenund, and Ethelston, Pierre having
taken his place near the latter, and Baptiste occupying his
usual station beside his young master, and leaning upon his
enormous hatchet. If the intentions of White&ndash;bull were
treacherous, he found no greater encouragement to his hopes
from a survey of the leaders,—men of powerful form, and
grave, determined aspect, with the exception of Wingenund,
whose youth and slight figure might have led a stranger to
fear him less as an opponent. He had, however, given such
proof of his skill, courage, and activity in Indian warfare,
that the Crows did not look upon him with less respect than
upon the more experienced men by whom he was surrounded.</p>

<p>When the Upsaroka deputation had finished the portion of
bison&ndash;meat set before them, Reginald gave them a treat, such
as they had never before enjoyed, in the shape of a tin&ndash;cup
full of coffee, sweetened with sugar, which they passed round,
and tasted at first with some reluctance, owing to its dark
colour, taking it for “Great Medicine.” After sipping it once
or twice, however, they seemed to find it more palatable, and
drank all that was offered to them, and then the pipe was
lighted and smoked with due solemnity.</p>

<p>When these preliminaries were concluded, the business of
the day was entered upon, and was conducted with equal
caution and distrust on both sides; Besha being, of course,
the interpreter, and moulding the respective communications
in the manner most likely, according to his views, to ensure
the continuance of the truce agreed upon; because he had
been most distinctly warned by Wingenund, that he would
receive no present until all the terms of the treaty were duly
fulfilled, and that then he might expect one liberal enough to
adorn the wigwam of a chief. The crafty horse&ndash;dealer had,
at the same time, contrived to persuade the Crows that the
white men were secretly disinclined to the treaty, and that
they could only be induced to observe it by his own cunning
and contrivance.</p>

<p>This being the relative position of the parties, it may well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
be imagined that the diplomatic arrangements were neither
very long nor difficult, and it was finally agreed that the
Crows should, when called upon, supply the party with a
trusty guide, who should lead them eastward by the route on
which they would find the easiest travelling and the best
supply of bison; that an alliance for mutual defence should
exist between the parties so long as they were within the
boundaries of the Crow country, but that they should never
encamp nearer to each other than at a distance of twice the
longflight of an arrow; that so soon as they should emerge
from the defiles of the mountains, the Crows should supply
their allies with twenty horses, some of those which they had
brought from the settlements being travel&ndash;worn and exhausted;
and that Besha was to have free leave to come and go from
one encampment to the other at all hours of the day or night,
in the event of any communication being necessary.</p>

<p>The allied band agreed, in consideration of the above conditions,
to present the Crows with a certain number of bales
of cloth, a score of blankets, and an ample supply of beads,
paint, and knives; one&ndash;third of the amount to be paid on the
delivery of the horses, and the remainder when the parties
separated on the Great Prairie, at the eastern boundary of the
Upsaroka country.</p>

<p>These terms having been written down by Reginald, he
read them slowly one after the other, Wingenund repeating
them to Besha, and he again translating them to White&ndash;bull,
who nodded his approbation as they were successively recapitulated;
after which Reginald and Ethelston, having signed
their names in pencil, desired Besha and White&ndash;bull to affix
their mark.</p>

<p>The former did so without hesitation; but the latter made
all kinds of excuses, and looked extremely puzzled, whispering
his doubts and fears to his interpreter, who, being a reckless
fellow, and having seen more of the world, could scarce
forbear laughing in his face.</p>

<p>In truth, the Crow chief, though brave and daring in the
field, was not above the superstitions current in his tribe, and
he entertained a kind of vague notion that, by putting his
mark upon the paper, he brought himself under the power of
the white man’s medicine.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was at length persuaded, and drew upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
the paper, with a hand not unskilful, the broad forehead and
projecting horns of a bison’s head, which design represented
his consent to the treaty.</p>

<p>No sooner was the business concluded than the presents
were brought forth, and distributed according to the terms prescribed,
Reginald adding for the chief a hair&ndash;brush, in the
back of which a small mirror was set. Never had such a
curiosity been seen in the Crow country, and White&ndash;bull
turned it over and over in his hand, contemplating it and
himself in it with undisguised satisfaction, while Pierre whispered
to Baptiste, “If Madame Bending&ndash;willow is in favour,
she will have it before to&ndash;morrow.”</p>

<p>The Crows now took their leave, amid many protestations
of friendship on both sides, and returned with all speed towards
their own encampment, White&ndash;bull’s mind being divided
between delight at the possession of his brush, and dread at
the mysterious dangers he might have incurred by putting his
mark upon the white man’s paper.</p>

<p>The departure of their wild allies left the party at the camp
leisure to return to their ordinary avocations, and to the sad
recollection of their chief’s condition; indeed, a very short
time elapsed before he sent a message by Paul Müller, desiring
that they would all come to him without delay.</p>

<p>The tone of deep yet composed sadness in which it was
delivered, announced to most of those who heard it that War&ndash;Eagle
was drawing near to his end; and Reginald, passing
his arm within that of Wingenund, whispered to him, as he
went, such words of sympathy as he thought most like to
soothe and console him.</p>

<p>“Dear Netis,” replied the youth, in a tone of the deepest
melancholy, “you are very good, but there is no happiness
more for Wingenund!”</p>

<p>“Say not so, my young brother; you are still in the early
spring of life, and I hope, when these present sorrows are past,
you will yet enjoy a long and happy day of summer.”</p>

<p>“Wingenund’s spring and summer are both gone! but he
does not complain: it is the will of the Great Spirit, and
Wingenund knows that what He does is right.”</p>

<p>As he said these words they reached the tent, and the day
being extremely fine, the poles of that compartment were
taken up, and the canvass folded back, at the request of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
chief, that he might once more look upon the sun, and feel
the fresh mountain breeze upon his cheek.</p>

<p>Lita had retired into the inner tent, and Prairie&ndash;bird was
seated at his side, a cup of water being the only source of
relief to which she from time to time had recourse to cool his
lips and recruit his ebbing strength.</p>

<p>The whole party being gathered round him, Wingenund,
Reginald, and Ethelston somewhat in advance of the rest, he
addressed the former in a low but distinct voice, saying, “War&ndash;Eagle
is going on the dark path, from which he will not
return; Wingenund will be chief of the Lenapé band; has
he any thing to say while War&ndash;Eagle is yet chief?”</p>

<p>“He has,” replied the youth, in a voice tremulous from
emotion; “a treaty has been made with the Upsaroka, does
War&ndash;Eagle think it good?” He then proceeded to enumerate
its several terms and conditions.</p>

<p>“It is good,” said the chief, after a few moments’ reflection:
“only let Netis and Wingenund remember that the
Upsaroka are double&ndash;tongued; they hate the Black&ndash;feet, and
will be glad to spend my brother’s powder and blood in destroying
their enemies. Let my brothers keep near the home&ndash;path,
and not wander from it to please the Upsaroka. Is there
more that my brother wishes to say?”</p>

<p>“There is more, my brother. Here are the four Osage
captives taken among the Upsaroka. Their deeds of blood
are known to War&ndash;Eagle. Let him say what shall be done
with them.”</p>

<p>“Let them stand forward,” said the chief, raising himself
with difficulty from the blanket&ndash;cushion against which he had
been reclining.</p>

<p>They were accordingly brought to the front of the circle,
and stood awaiting their doom with the fierce determined air
of warriors who knew and feared it not. The eldest among
them was a fine powerful man, who bore about him the marks
of many a fray, and had been one of the leading braves who
followed the fortunes of Mahéga. He it was who acted as
spokesman in the dialogue that ensued.</p>

<p><i>War&ndash;Eagle.</i> “Have the Washashee any thing to say that
their lives should not be given to the slow fire?”</p>

<p><i>Osage.</i> “The warriors of the Washashee talk with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
hands, when their hands are not tied; they are not famous
for their tongues.”</p>

<p><i>W.</i> “Yet with their tongues they spoke smooth words to
the Lenapé: they called them brother; they ate, hunted,
fought, and smoked with them, and then joined the Dahcotahs,
to kill the women and children of their friends. If the
tongues of the Washashee are not famous, they are forked.”</p>

<p><i>O.</i> “Mahéga was the war&ndash;chief of his tribe; when he went
upon the war&ndash;path, the Washashee followed. He is gone to
the hunting&ndash;fields of the braves, and they are not afraid to
follow him. When War&ndash;Eagle took his rifle and his club,
and went out upon the war&ndash;path by night, his warriors followed
in silence. Who among them said, ‘Where does War&ndash;Eagle
go?’”</p>

<p><i>W.</i> “War&ndash;Eagle never raised his rifle at a friend; he
never called out his braves to burn the wigwam of his brother;
there was never a scalp of woman or child taken by his hand.
When he struck it was at an open foe, or to save or avenge a
friend.” He added in a subdued tone, “And yet there is too
much blood on the hands of War&ndash;Eagle; the Great Spirit is
angry with him for it.”</p>

<p>The Osage made no reply. The missionary interchanged
a whispered word with Prairie&ndash;bird, and the chief continued,
addressing chiefly the Delawares in their own language; “My
brothers, we often pray to the Great Spirit to forgive what we
have done that is wrong. The Black Father and Olitipa
have told War&ndash;Eagle the answer that he gives; it is written
in the great book in which there are no lies: ‘The Great
Spirit will forgive us, if we forgive our brother; if we refuse
to forgive our brother, the Great Spirit will refuse to forgive
us.’ War&ndash;Eagle has done many things wrong; he hopes the
Great Spirit will forgive him. Shall he now kill the Washashee?”
He then turned to the prisoners, and said, “Let
their bands be cut, and let them return to their own people to
tell them, that the Lenapé hurt not women nor children, nor
men whose hands are tied. Olitipa has read from the book
that such is the will of the Great Spirit, whom the white men
call by the name of God, and the heart of War&ndash;Eagle tells
him that it is true.”</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether this speech caused greater surprise
among his own followers, or among the Osages, whom it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
restored to life and liberty. Both, however, heard it with
that absence of outward emotion which characterises the red&ndash;skin
race in North America; so that Ethelston, who did not
understand a word of the Delaware tongue, was perfectly
unconscious of anything having been said that might materially
affect the fortunes of the prisoners; and he was in
momentary expectation of seeing them led away to suffer,
according to the laws of Indian retribution, the deserved
penalty of their cruelty and treachery.</p>

<p>While Pierre was informing him of what had occurred, the
Osage spokesman resolved apparently to try the patience of
the expiring chief to the uttermost, and said to him, with a
sneer, “War&ndash;Eagle is very good to the Washashee; he knows
that they have neither food nor arms; there is not one knife
among the four: they are among the mountains, a whole
moon’s journey from their village, surrounded by war&ndash;parties
of the Upsaroka and Black&ndash;feet, and on their return path must
pass the hunting&ndash;grounds of the Shiennes, the Kiowás, the
Pânis, and the Mahas. War&ndash;Eagle would rather that they
were starved, and their bones gnawed by the wolves, than see
them die like warriors, and laugh at the Lenapé in their
death.”</p>

<p>Paul Müller looked anxiously at the chief to mark what
effect would be produced by this ungrateful and intemperate
speech; and his apprehensions were much relieved when he
heard War&ndash;Eagle reply, in a calm and unmoved tone: “There
is no wonder that the Washashee think others are like themselves,
false&ndash;hearted and double&ndash;tongued. Had the Lenapé
intended that the Washashee should be killed, they would
have spared the Upsaroka and the wolves the task. War&ndash;Eagle
intends that they should live to be ashamed of their bad
deeds. Wingenund will see that they enter safely on the
home&ndash;path. Now let them go; their words are bitter, and
they can neither speak nor believe the truth. War&ndash;Eagle has
no more time to waste with them.”</p>

<p>As he uttered this reproof, in a contemptuous rather an
angry tone, the chief fell back much exhausted upon his
cushion, and the leading Osage was about to make some violent
reply, when Pierre, taking him by the arm, hurried him and
his companions to the outer edge of the circle, saying to him,
as he went, “Peace, fool! Is thy thick head so fond of tasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
a Lenapé tomahawk, that thou canst not hold thy tongue,
when thy saucy wagging of it might cost thy life? Peace, I
say, or in spite of the chief’s pardon, I will have thee and thy
comrades tied down again like fresh&ndash;caught colts.”</p>

<p>Having spoken words to this effect to the reckless and grumbling
Osage, Pierre re&ndash;entered the circle gathered round the
chief, and found, on his return, that a general silence prevailed.
Wingenund was sitting upon the ground, close to his brother,
listening with the deepest attention to the injunctions and
counsel which the latter was delivering, in a voice that became
every moment more feeble and indistinct. None present could
overhear what passed; but at the conclusion the two brothers
sat for a few seconds in silence, each pressing his clenched
hand upon the heart of the other, after which Wingenund retired
a few paces back, while the chief, collecting his remaining
strength, said aloud to his devoted followers: “War&ndash;Eagle is
going to the land where his fathers dwell; he is sorry to leave
his brothers, but it is the will of the Great Spirit, who is the
Master of Life;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and when he speaks the Lenapé are silent,
and obey. When War&ndash;Eagle is gone, it is his wish that
Wingenund should be chief of the band: the blood of Tamenund
warms his heart; and though he has not seen many summers,
his eyes have not been shut, nor have his ears been
closed against the counsel of wise men. My brothers, you
have the care of a great treasure, the care of Olitipa, the beloved
daughter of Tamenund, the sister who has cleared away
the cloud that hid the sun from War&ndash;Eagle, and the thorns
that beset his path in the dark valley. My brothers, let not
one of you leave her until she is safe at the white man’s
boundary; and if you love War&ndash;Eagle, you will also love and
obey Wingenund, and Netis his adopted brother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p>A deep suppressed murmur was the only reply made by the
gloomy warriors around; but War&ndash;Eagle knew its import, and
read its confirmation on the determined countenances of those
who had so often followed him to strife and victory.</p>

<p>The mortal agony was at hand, and the chief, feeling its approach,
looked suddenly round as if he missed some one who
should be there: his utterance was scarcely articulate, but
Prairie&ndash;bird caught the intended sound of Lita’s name, and
flying into the tent, speedily returned, bringing with her the
weeping girl. Again he contrived to make Prairie&ndash;bird understand
his wish, that an armlet of beads that he wore should
be taken off and hung round Lita’s neck; the chief smiled and
said, “Lita has been faithful to Olitipa, and very good to War&ndash;Eagle;
the Great Spirit will reward her.”</p>

<p>The destroyer was now rapidly tightening his fell coils
round the vital organs, but the chief still retained sufficient
strength to press the hand of each of his sorrowing friends in
succession against that generous heart which must so soon
cease to beat. Wingenund was the last; and as he stooped over
his brother, whispered to him a word that reached the ear of
Prairie&ndash;bird; and while it richly rewarded her pious and affectionate
toil, lighted up at the same time the countenance of the
dying man with a smile of triumph that bid defiance to the
pangs of the grisly king of terrors. From the time that he
received his fatal wounds, not a groan nor a murmur of complaint
had escaped him; and when he resigned his parting
breath, it was with the peaceful tranquillity of childhood falling
asleep.</p>

<p>“My children,” said the missionary, solemnly, “War&ndash;Eagle,
the son of Tamenund, is no more! In life none walked
more uprightly than he, according to the light that was given
to him! He gave up his life to save that of another, and
after enduring grievous pains with the heroism of an Indian
warrior, he died with a full hope and trust in the redeeming
mercy of his God. Peace be with his soul; and may we all
rejoin him hereafter in the land where separation and sorrow
will be unknown!”</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">WAR&ndash;EAGLE’S FUNERAL.—THE PARTY COMMENCE THEIR HOMEWARD
JOURNEY.—BESHA EXERTS HIS DIPLOMATIC TALENTS FOR THE
LAST TIME, AND RECEIVES SEVERAL REWARDS, WITH SOME OF
WHICH HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DISPENSED.</p>

<p class="pn">It may well be imagined what a gloom was cast over the
whole party by the death of the Delaware leader; not only
among those who, like Reginald, Wingenund, and Prairie&ndash;bird,
mourned for him as for a departed brother, but even among
the rough hunters and woodsmen, to whom he had endeared
himself no less by his dauntless courage than by a thousand
acts of kindness and generosity. As for his own trusty Lenapé
warriors their spirit seemed entirely broken; too proud
to weep or lament, they walked to and fro by the spot where
his remains still rested, casting upon the dark cloth by which
they were covered desponding and melancholy looks; and
when Baptiste, whom they esteemed as the long&ndash;tried friend of
their late chief, tried to offer a few words of consolation, hinting
also at the virtues and qualities of the surviving brother, they
shook their heads and returned to cherish their grief, like the
wife of Phinehas, who when she heard that her husband and
her father&ndash;in&ndash;law were dead, and the Ark captured, regarded
not the consolation of her new&ndash;born child, but called it Ichabod,
saying “The glory is departed from Israel.”</p>

<p>“Ethelston,” said Reginald to his friends, “methinks the
sooner we strike our camp, and move from this sad spot, the
better: it is necessary, from the progress that mortification
has made in the frame of our lamented friend, that he should
be buried immediately. Let us speak to Wingenund, and see
whether he wishes it performed according to our customs, or
according to those of his own people; for in this we ought not
to dictate to him.”</p>

<p>Having joined the youth, whom they found standing in an
attitude of dejection at no great distance, Reginald, after a few
words of kindly sympathy, proposed to him the subject under
discussion. To the surprise of both, they found him quite
prepared for it. “Yes,” he said; “War&ndash;Eagle said to Wingenund
what he wished, and it shall be done this day. First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
let us obey his commands about the Washashee; let them be
called before the tent, and let the hunters and the Lenapé be
summoned too.”</p>

<p>This was soon done; and the party being assembled, the
Osages were once more brought forward, their limbs having been
freed from the thongs by which they had been bound; and the
general stock of meat, fresh as well as dried, was also, by desire
of Wingenund, placed before the tent. These preliminaries
being completed, the young chief addressed them as follows:
“Washashee, it is known to you that War&ndash;Eagle,
forgiving your bad deeds, gave you your lives—the Lenapé
respect the wishes of their great chief, and will not send you
away with empty hands.” He then desired that a fair proportion
of meat, a rifle, with a reasonable supply of ammunition,
a knife, and a small package of Indian presents should
be given to each of the Osages. These orders having been
punctually, though reluctantly, obeyed by one of the Delaware
warriors, Wingenund continued: “if the Washashee fear to
enter upon the long home&ndash;path with so few men, they may
camp under the shelter of the Lenapé fires—they cannot be
called brothers, but no harm shall be done to them.”</p>

<p>“The Washashee,” replied the powerful Indian who has
before been mentioned as the spokesman of the Osages, and
who now grasped his restored rifle with an air of fierce
exultation—“the Washashee have no fear—they will go
upon the path alone—they will not dwell a night by the
fires of the Lenapé camp. Wingenund is a young chief,
and the Lenapé need not be ashamed when they speak his
name; his words and his years are few, but his deeds will
be told where the council of warriors meet. His hand is
open—but it is red with the blood of their great chief: the
Washashee thank him, but they cannot call the Lenapé brothers.
The Washashee have no more to say; before the night
falls, their feet will be far on the homeward path.”</p>

<p>So saying, the grim warrior stalked away with his three
companions, the assembled party looking after them in silence,
until their forms were lost behind a rock that projected into
the valley.</p>

<p>“Proud and thankless scoundrels,” muttered Baptiste, half
aloud to the hunter who stood nearest to him. “Had my
opinion been taken, they should have been flogged with cow&ndash;hides
out of the camp, and they might have found their way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
as they could to their cut&ndash;throat friends the Dahcotahs!
‘Twas always so with War&ndash;Eagle, and will be the same with
Wingenund! When the skrimmage was over, and his blood
was cool, there was no more cruelty in his natur’ than there is
in that of a Philadelphy Quaker.”</p>

<p>Wingenund having spoken for a few minutes with the missionary,
a party of half a dozen men were desired by the
latter to dig a grave for the deceased chief under a scathed
and picturesque pine that stood alone on a small natural
mound near the river. It was a spot that seemed to have
been framed by the hand of the Creator for a sepulchre, rising
as it did in the centre of a wild and unfrequented vale, surrounded
on all sides by precipitous rocks, beyond which rose in
the distance the snow&ndash;clad summits of the gigantic mountain&ndash;range—the
fittest natural emblem of Eternity; while round
the base of the mound flowed the bubbling stream, a memento,
no less apt, of the changeful and fleeting nature of all
the things belonging to this earthly scene.</p>

<p>The descending sun was just beginning to gild the peaks of
the Western Andes when the party assembled to pay the last
tribute of affectionate regard to the mortal remains of their
late leader. Prairie&ndash;bird and her faithful Lita attended, both
having their faces veiled by a shawl, and the former supported
by her newly restored brother; nor was there one of the
party absent from the mournful ceremony, which was commenced
(as soon as the body, still enveloped and bound in
dark cloth, was placed near the grave,) by a brief address
from Wingenund, in which he said:</p>

<p>“My brothers know that War&ndash;Eagle was a great chief;
that the blood of many warriors ran in his veins. The enemies
of the Lenapé were his enemies, and their friends his
friends. When their warriors went forth to battle, he was
not the last; and when they returned, his war&ndash;club could tell
a tale.” A deep murmur of assent was uttered by the Delawares,
and Wingenund continued:—“War&ndash;Eagle loved the
Lenapé from his childhood; and in his last moments he
prayed to the Great Spirit for their happiness. He also told
Wingenund that Olitipa and the Black Father had read to
him many wonderful things from the Great Spirit’s Book;
that he had thought much of them, and found them very
good, and very true: they had made his heart so glad, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
he wished Wingenund and his Lenapé brothers to hear them,
that they might learn how to please the Great Spirit, and to
obey His will. Wingenund promised War&ndash;Eagle, that when
the Black Father told them the commands of the Great Spirit
written in the book, the ears of the Lenapé should be open
to listen to the words of his wisdom, and to let his counsel
guide their feet. My brothers, such were the wishes of War&ndash;Eagle,
great chief of the Unâmi band of the Ancient People.
Wingenund has told them truly, and he intends to obey them
himself: his years are yet too few, that he should advise
others; let each of my brothers think of these things wisely,
and act as the Great Spirit shall incline his heart.”</p>

<p>A long and profound silence followed this speech; after
which Paul Müller, approaching the mound, desired that the
body might be lowered into the grave: when this was done,
he addressed first the Delawares, setting forth the virtues of
the deceased chieftain, and laying the greatest stress upon
those which were of a more mild and peaceful character. He
touched also most feelingly upon the occasion on which he
had received the injuries from which he died; assuring the
Delawares that no length of time, nor changes of life, would
ever efface from the memory of Prairie&ndash;bird, or those to whom
she was so dear, the devoted heroism of her deliverer. “But,
my beloved brothers,” said he in conclusion, “great as was
the gift that he gave to her, even his life for hers, he received
from her a gift much greater; for it is my humble hope and
belief, that through her entreaty and prayer, his eyes were open
to see things that he had never seen before; and, having once
seen their riches and their beauty, he desired that you, my
brothers, should see them too. He learnt what, I fear, you
cannot yet understand,—that it is the will of the Great Spirit
that we should observe and study His works, and copy them.
Is it true, my friends? Is there sense in my words?”</p>

<p>He paused for a reply. The elder Delawares looked at
each other, and then, as if by mutual consent, nodded their
assent.</p>

<p>The missionary continued:—“Well, then, the Great
Spirit is merciful and just, kind and forgiving; loving peace
and hating strife. How do we try to please him? By hating
peace, and being swift to shed blood; by revenging where we
ought to forgive, and dealing harshly by those on whom we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
ought to have mercy. The Osages who are just gone are
wicked men; they have been guilty of treachery and cruelty;
and you are disappointed that you were not permitted to kill
them, and that Wingenund sent them away unhurt. They
have been wicked, far more wicked, towards the Great Spirit;
they have disobeyed His commands, despised His laws, destroyed
the creatures of His hand, and have insulted Him and
braved His anger for weeks, for months, and years! How
has He treated them? He has given them water from His
clouds, and has brought the herds of bison to their hunting&ndash;ground,
and has given the sun to warm them by day, and the
moon and stars to light their path by night? And if even
now one of them—nay, the very worst among them, were to
have his heart softened, and to turn to the Great Spirit, and
to say, ‘My Father, in heaven, I am sorry for all the wrong
that I have done, O forgive and guide me, for I wish to do
so no more!’ it is written in that book, by the hand of the
Great Spirit himself, that He would forgive that sorrowful
man, and bless him, and turn the bitterness of his heart into
gladness and joy sweeter than honey! These things, my
dear brothers, are not learnt in a day; but, I thank God that
by his blessing, and the affectionate and patient labours of
Olitipa, the eyes of War&ndash;Eagle were opened to see them;
and he desired that those whom he most loved should see and
feel them like himself. We will now take our last farewell of
him on earth, after the manner of those who love, fear, and
obey the word of the Father of us all.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the worthy missionary knelt by the
side of the newly filled grave, and concluded the solemnities
of the occasion by an affecting prayer in the English tongue;
Reginald, Ethelston, and all the hunters and woodsmen, kneeling
uncovered, and finally joining in that perfect model of
supplication taught by the Redeemer himself to those who, in
whatever age or clime, are called by His name.</p>

<p>Having paid these last honours to their departed friend, the
leaders of the party withdrew to make the proposed arrangements
for striking the camp on the following morning, and for
settling the line and order of march.</p>

<p>The Delawares lingered for some time, as if unwilling to
leave the remains of their beloved chief, and at length slowly
retired, one by one, until there remained only our old friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
Baptiste and a veteran Delaware, who, from his feats of hardihood,
and the stern fierceness of his nature, was generally
known by the name of Stony&ndash;heart.</p>

<p>“Grand&ndash;Hâche,” said the latter, addressing his companion,
“it may be all very good what the Black Father says, but
Stony&ndash;heart does not understand it. When War&ndash;Eagle said
that the Lenapé should not kill those who had taken the scalps
of their warriors or of their women, the Mad Spirit must have
got into his brain! Stony&ndash;heart has seen many winters, and
has heard the talk of the wise men in council, but he never
heard such words as these.”</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Baptiste was not in his heart a
very strong advocate for the doctrine of forgiveness; we have
already seen in a former chapter that he was rather disposed
to favour the Indian law of retaliation; he answered, however,
on this occasion cautiously.</p>

<p>“Stony&ndash;heart speaks true; yet he must remember that
War&ndash;Eagle only desired that his Lenapé brothers should hear
what the Black Father had to say on this matter; they can
then decide whether his words are idle or not. It will be
easier for him to persuade the young than men who like us
have known for forty winters that the custom of the woods,
and of the prairie, is life for life, and scalp for scalp!”</p>

<p>“It will,” rejoined the other; “and Grand&ndash;Hâche will
see that no good will follow from having spared the lives of
those four Washashee dogs.”</p>

<p>With this prophetic observation, Stony&ndash;heart rejoined his
comrades, and Baptiste joined the small group assembled before
the door of the tent.</p>

<p>On the following morning the party began their homeward
march, Wingenund leading the way, followed by his Delawares,
and accompanied by Besha and the Crow guide, who had been
sent for by a runner before daybreak. The packed mules and
horses were placed in the centre under the special charge of
Monsieur Perrot, whose fund of good&ndash;humour and resource
had never failed him, and who now performed the office of a
muleteer with the same readiness with which he fulfilled the
respective duties of valet to Reginald, and cook, messman, and
buffoon to the whole party. The rear was brought up by
Ethelston and Reginald, the latter still keeping his post at the
bridle of Nekimi, the line of march being closed by Baptiste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
and some of the most experienced hunters, while Pierre was
sent forward to aid Wingenund, he being the most skilful and
practised in the peculiar difficulties of the dangerous region
which they were now about to traverse.</p>

<p>For several days all went on as well as could be expected.
The heat was intense, and water was sometimes scarce; several
of the mules and pack&ndash;horses dropped down from exhaustion,
and were left behind; the stock of provisions was somewhat
short, but the party twice fell in with a small herd of buffalo,
from which they procured a tolerable supply; and, at camping
time, they all assembled round the fire in front of Prairie&ndash;bird’s
tent, and, after their frugal evening meal, wore away the time
with conversation suited to the different groups into which the
party divided itself, some talking over former campaigns, others
cracking their jokes and enjoying the laugh which invariably
followed Perrot’s determined attempts to explain himself in
the Delaware tongue; while Reginald, Ethelston, and Prairie&ndash;bird
lived over again the days of their childhood, or recounted
to each other some of the most interesting incidents of the
intervening years.</p>

<p>All remarked the changed aspect and increased gravity of
Wingenund; his manner was indeed gentle and quiet as
before, but the death of his brother, and the responsibility
now entrusted to him, added to other serious matters which
occupied his mind, seemed in him to have annihilated the
interval between early youth and ripened manhood. First to
rise before daybreak, and last to lie down at night, he seemed
unconscious of fatigue, and resolved that on this occasion at
least the Delawares should not from his neglect be reminded
of the loss that they had so lately sustained. At night he
visited the sentries, and saw that every one was at his allotted
post; and on the march, whenever the nature of the ground
rendered precaution necessary, scouts were sent forward to examine
it, and to guard against ambush or surprise. Every
evening he joined the little party before the tent, and never
left it without wishing his sister (as he still called Prairie&ndash;bird)
a night of rest, and asking a blessing from the lips of
the Black Father.</p>

<p>The Crows behaved upon this occasion better than had been
expected of them, camping always at a certain distance from
the allied party, and observing faithfully the other conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
of the treaty. The guide, whom they had supplied, led the
way towards the Great Prairie, by a valley considerably to the
northward of that by which they had entered the mountain
region; and Pierre soon perceived that its eastern termination
was at a spot that was easily recognised, by all experienced
trappers, as the “Devil’s Kettle,” owing to the steam that ascended
from a hot&ndash;spring, celebrated for its medicinal qualities
among the neighbouring tribes.</p>

<p>Here the fresh horses promised by the Crows were supplied,
and an equal number of those exhausted and incapable of further
travel, were left behind. Nekimi, alone of the whole
quadruped band, seemed insensible alike to the scantiness of
pasture, and the heat and fatigue of the journey. The fair
burthen that he bore was as that of a feather compared to the
powerful frame of his former rider when armed and equipped,
and the noble animal seemed desirous of expressing his gratitude
for the change, by rubbing his forehead against Reginald
as he walked before him, or nibbling out of his hand a few
young shoots of alder or willow, that he was now and then
fortunate enough to cut by the half&ndash;dried bed of some mountain
stream.</p>

<p>In this way they travelled forward without accident or adventure,
until they reached the banks of a river of considerable
size, which Pierre conjectured to be the head&ndash;water of the
southern fork of the Neosho, or the Platte; and here they
were to complete the terms of the treaty, and bid adieu to
their Upsaroka friends, the opposite banks of the river not
being considered within the limits of their hunting ground.</p>

<p>The ceremonials observed upon this occasion were much
the same as the preceding, with the exception that Bending&ndash;willow
paid a visit to Prairie&ndash;bird, received from her several
presents, drank a cup of the wonderful black liquor, of which
her husband had told her, namely, coffee sweetened with
sugar, and told her fair hostess that his affections had not as
yet strayed to any other of his spouses,—a fact, the truth of
which was attested by her displaying, with the most ostentatious
coquetry, the mirror&ndash;backed brush, of which he was
more proud of than of any thing that he possessed.</p>

<p>Besha made himself wonderfully busy during the payment
of the presents due to the Crows; and in one or two instances,
when the latter claimed more than was recorded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
Reginald’s memorandum, he stoutly maintained that the white
men were right, and recommended the Crows to withdraw
their pretensions: in so doing, he did not neglect to whisper
every now and then to Baptiste or Pierre, a hint that he
intended to be paid for his disinterested support.</p>

<p>All this was not lost upon White&ndash;bull, who, although he
could not understand a word of what passed, felt nevertheless
convinced that the interpreter was playing some under&ndash;game.
He said nothing, however; and the distribution was satisfactorily
completed, Wingenund and Reginald adding gratuitously
several presents for the chiefs beyond those promised in
the treaty. Besha, to the surprise of many of the Crows, who
knew his avaricious disposition, went away, apparently well
satisfied, with nothing more than a blanket and a knife; but
they did not know that he had privately whispered to Baptiste
that he would come by night to fetch away his stipulated
snare of the presents (and that, too, a lion’s share), as the
Crows might be jealous if they saw them, and might take them
from him.</p>

<p>The two parties, having taken their final leave of each
other, the task of guide devolved upon Pierre, who resolved
not to cross the Platte that evening, it being now rather late,
but to encamp where they were, while the Crows returned
some dozen miles upon their trail before they encamped for
the night. They had seen enough of the effective force and
discipline of the allied band to deter them from attacking it,
and prudently resolved to return to their own country, with the
goods which they had already acquired, without loss or risk;
although it becomes us, as veracious historians, to state (however
little credit the statement may reflect upon White&ndash;bull)
that it had been, from the first, his intention to attack and
plunder the party, had their carelessness or neglect afforded
him an opportunity of doing so with impunity.</p>

<p>Besha, having ascertained the spot selected for the Crow
encampment, lingered behind their line of march, accompanied
by the lad before mentioned, as being his constant
attendant, whom he left concealed, with two of his horses,
behind a small hillock beside the trail, desiring him there to
await his return. In order to avoid suspicion, he continued in
the company of White&ndash;bull until it was dusk, and did not
leave the camp until an hour later, when he threw a large dark&ndash;coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
blanket over his shoulders, and, slipping away unperceived,
rejoined the lad left in charge of the horses.</p>

<p>Mounting one himself, he desired his companion to follow
on the other, and trotted briskly forward, under the partial
light of a young moon, over the ground which he had carefully
noted during the day, until he reached a spot where the
trail approached within a hundred yards of the banks of the
Platte, and where a few alder bushes offered convenient shelter
for the horses. Here the lad was again desired to await his
master’s return; and as the dew began to fall heavy, he was
not sorry that the latter left with him the large dark&ndash;coloured
blanket above mentioned.</p>

<p>Besha now pursued his way on foot; and on reaching the
outposts of the allied band found, as had been preconcerted,
two of the Delawares, bearing several large packages, containing
the presents and goods that he had earned in his mixed
capacity of diplomatic agent and interpreter. The packages
being inconvenient for the horse&ndash;dealer to carry alone, both on
account of their weight and number, he prevailed upon one of
the Delawares to assist him in carrying them to the spot where
he had left the horses. It was only by offering the Indian,
who was no other than Stony&ndash;heart, a little bag full of excellent
kinne&ndash;kinnik for his pipe, that he prevailed upon him to
undertake this task. But the materials for smoking had become
scarce, and it was an indulgence from which, when within
reach, Stony&ndash;heart could not refrain; he accordingly sent back
his companion, and telling him that he would return in the
course of an hour or two, set forth with the horse&ndash;dealer on the
trail.</p>

<p>We must now see how it fared with the lad left in charge
of the horses, who, being tired with the day’s march, fastened
the end of their long halters to his arm, and, wrapping himself
in the blanket, lay down upon the grass, and soon fell into a
comfortable doze. One of the horses, probably disliking this
unusual separation from those with which it was accustomed
at this hour to feed, neighed several times aloud, for which
disturbance of his slumber it received a pull of the halter, and
a muttered execration from the youth, when he again fell into
a state of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the neighing of the horse reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
other ears at no great distance, being those of no less a person
than the Osage, who, with his three companions, was on his
homeward way, and had on the preceding day stolen an old
canoe that they found on the bank of the river; and, after
patching up a few rents and holes, had embarked in it, to save
themselves a portion of their long foot journey. They had
seen from a distance the moving bands of the white men and
of the Crows, and had hauled their canoe under some alder
bushes on the bank, in order to consult and determine whether
they should drop farther down the river during the night, or,
leaving it, strike a more southerly course.</p>

<p>Whilst holding this consultation, the neighing of Besha’s
horse caught the quick ear of their leader; he listened—and
hearing it repeated, crept towards the spot, followed by his
three companions. As soon as the uncertain light of the moon
enabled him to distinguish the two pack&ndash;horses fastened to the
sleeping lad, he again crept noiselessly forward, and, springing
upon him, enveloped him in his own blanket, stuffing the
corner of it into his mouth, so that he could neither struggle
nor make any noise.</p>

<p>Leaving one of his men in charge of the horses, he carried
the youth swiftly to the water’s edge where he securely pinioned
and gagged him, not, however, before he had recognised
by the moonlight the countenance of Besha’s attendant. The
Osage’s plan was soon formed; for he rightly conjectured that
the horse&ndash;dealer was gone upon some errand, from which he
would not return empty handed; and he also owed the horse&ndash;dealer
a grudge for having, as he supposed, favoured Wingenund
in that eventful scene which terminated Mahéga’s life.</p>

<p>Stripping the youth of his dark blanket and of the broad&ndash;brimmed
hat of Mexican grass that he wore, the Osage put
them on himself; and, taking his seat by the same bush, he
held the halters of the horses, and partially concealing his face
in one of the folds of the blanket, awaited in this disguise the
return of the horse&ndash;dealer, while his three companions concealed
themselves behind the adjacent bushes.</p>

<p>They had not been very long ensconced before Besha appeared,
followed by the doughty Stony&ndash;heart, who muttered to
himself as he came that he would not carry such a load so far
again for all the kinne&ndash;kinnik in the camp. The horse&ndash;dealer
as he drew near gave the usual signal&ndash;whistle for his attendant;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
and, finding that it was unanswered, looked towards the spot
where he descried the slumbering figure in the slouched hat
and dark blanket; while one of his pack&ndash;horses, lately cast
loose, seemed to be deliberately walking off to seek better pasture.
Hastily throwing his own package to the ground, he went
to secure the stray animal, calling at the same time to Stony&ndash;heart,</p>

<p>“Kick that sleepy dog till he wakens, that he may come
and assist me with these packs.”</p>

<p>The Delaware, who was not a man of many words, proceeded
forthwith to execute this order, and, without putting down his
heavy load, bestowed a sound kick upon the reclining figure,
which, to his infinite surprise, started instantly to its feet in
the shape of a powerful man, who threw him, encumbered as
he was, upon the ground, and successfully resisted all his violent
efforts to extricate himself. While one of the Osages
came to assist in securing the fallen Delaware, the other two
seized the unlucky horse&ndash;dealer, just as he was mounting in
the hope of saving himself by flight.</p>

<p>So successfully had the Osages planned and executed this
man&oelig;uvre, that in less than five minutes their two last prisoners
were laid bound and pinioned together with the first in the
canoe, where the captured bales and presents were also stowed
away, and while one of the Osages took the horses to a ford
not far distant, which had been recently crossed by a large herd
of bison, the remaining three, with their prisoners, paddled
across the river, and then noiselessly along the opposite bank,
until they had reached a deep and winding creek, which fell
into the main river, and which they had noticed by daylight
as affording convenient fuel and shelter. Having pursued
their way up the creek until they considered themselves safe
from pursuit, and their fire from the observation of either encampment,
they gathered and lighted a goodly pile of dry
alder&ndash;wood, and proceeded deliberately to unpack and examine
the bales and packages, throwing their three pinioned captives
roughly on one side, as being so much live lumber unworthy
of their notice.</p>

<p>The plunder that they found themselves thus suddenly
possessed of exceeded their utmost expectations; and as it
contained, amongst other things, a package of excellent dried
meat and the kinne&ndash;kinnik, from which poor Stony&ndash;heart had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
expected so much gratification, they ate copiously of the
former, and smoked copiously of the latter, until they were in
the highest possible state of Osage enjoyment.</p>

<p>It was not long before they were joined by their comrade
with the horses, who received, as soon as he had fastened the
latter, his due share both of the provisions and the plunder;
after which they ungagged the prisoners, at the same time
giving them to understand that if they made the least noise
they would be put to death immediately. Indeed, whether
they were noisy or quiet, it seemed by no means improbable
that such might be their fate, for two of the Osages strongly
urged the necessity for so doing, under the plea of self&ndash;preservation.
The leader seemed, however, to be of a different
opinion, and he had already established a kind of prescriptive
right of command over his comrades.</p>

<p>Having thrown some dry sticks upon the fire to make it
blaze, he drew Stony&ndash;heart towards the light, and, as it fell
upon his countenance, enabled him to recognise in his prisoner
one of the chief warriors of the Delaware band.</p>

<p>“Is Stony&ndash;heart become a mule,” said he with a grin,
“that he carries bales and blankets upon his back?”</p>

<p>To this taunt Stony&ndash;heart did not deign to reply, and a
brief conversation ensued among the Osages; after which their
leader came again to him, and, having searched his dress, satisfied
himself that the Delaware had no other arms with him
than a knife and a small pistol concealed in his belt. The
former he left untouched, but the latter he dipped in the creek
until it was thoroughly soaked, and then returned it to the
owner, whom, having now released from his bands, he thus
addressed:</p>

<p>“Stony&ndash;heart may return to his people; he is free; and
he may tell Wingenund that the Washashee know how to
repay a good deed as well as to revenge a bad one. Stony&ndash;heart
may go!”</p>

<p>The Delaware waited no second bidding, but returned with
all haste towards his camp, being obliged to swim the river,
and muttering to himself, after he had crossed it, “I told
Baptiste that no good could ever come of sparing the lives of
those Washashee dogs!” Such being the only gratitude that
he either felt or expressed for the clemency that he had just
experienced at their hands!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after his departure, the Osages turned their attention
to Besha, sternly questioning him as to the part he had taken
in their late chief’s dispute with Wingenund; and in spite of
all his protestations of impartiality and innocence, they stripped
him of every article of clothing save his mocassins, and gave
him a most severe flogging with a laryette of bull’s&ndash;hide, after
which they decamped, leaving him still pinioned, and writhing
with pain, while they carried with them his attendant, whom
they compelled to load and arrange the packs upon the horses,
and to lead the latter for the first dozen miles of their route;
after which they permitted him to return to release his master,
who crawled back with difficulty, before daylight, to the Crow
camp, having reaped the reward of his intrigues, cunning, and
avarice, in the loss of all his presents, two of his best horses,
and a flogging, from the effects of which he suffered for a long
time.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SCENE IS SHIFTED TO THE BANKS OF THE MUSKINGUM, AND
PRAIRIE&ndash;BIRD RETURNS TO THE HOME OF HER CHILDHOOD.</p>

<p class="pn">About two months after the events related in the preceding
chapters, there was an unusual stir and bustle in the town of
Marietta, and half a score of its principal inhabitants were
assembled in front of David Muir’s house, to witness the landing
of the crew and passengers belonging to a large boat that
had just arrived at the wooden pier which projected into the
river.</p>

<p>Foremost of a busy group at the water’s edge was the sturdy
form of Gregson the mate, whose orders respecting the bringing&ndash;to,
and making fast, were implicitly obeyed; and when at
length she was securely moored alongside the pier, numerous
and hearty were the greetings between those who stepped
ashore from her, and the friends from whom they had been so
long severed.</p>

<p>“Bearskin, how are you? my old fresh&ndash;water porpoise!”
said the mate, squeezing the hard hand of the Mississippi
boatman. “How fares it, messmate?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right now, my hearty; but we’ve had some foul
weather since I saw you last.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I see!” said the mate, observing the scars upon his
old companion’s face and forehead; “you’ve been snagged,
and damaged your figure&ndash;head a bit: never mind that; we’ll
have all that yarn out by and bye over a bottle of David’s best.
See, here he comes to welcome you himself!”</p>

<p>Leaving David Muir and Bearskin to their mutual greetings,
the mate returned to the water&ndash;side and lent his powerful
assistance to the landing of the cargo of the heavily&ndash;laden
boat; and certainly, a more strange or heterogeneous mixture
of animate and inanimate stock never came out of any vessel
since the disembarkation from the ark. Skins, furs, bows,
rifles, moccassins, and Indian curiosities of every description,
were piled near the bows, while in the after&ndash;part were stowed
provisions of all kinds, and kegs, which were by no means so
full as they were when the boat left St. Louis.</p>

<p>The appearance, language, and costume of the crew would
baffle any attempt at description, inasmuch as each sunburnt,
unshaved individual composing it, had equipped and attired
himself according to his own fancy, and according to the contents
of his remaining wardrobe after a long sojourn in the
western wilderness: and when it is remembered that these
hardy fellows were from all the varied clans and nations found
between the sources and the mouth of the “Father of Waters,”
it is not surprising that their mingled jargon should have
struck upon the ear like the dialects of Babel in the day of its
confusion. There were half&ndash;bred Creeks and Cherokees;
Canadians, some with no little admixture of Chippeway blood;
others, proud of their pure French descent: there were also
some of the rough boatmen, who had already migrated to the
banks of the Great River, where it washes the western boundaries
of what are now the States of Kentucky and Illinois;
and a raw&ndash;boned sinewy fellow, who acted as a sort of second
mate, was giving instructions in broad Scotch, to a dark&ndash;eyed
and diminutive individual, who replied to him in bad Spanish.
Above the din of all these multifarious tongues, was heard the
shrill and incessant voice of Monsieur Perrot, who was labouring
with indefatigable zeal to collect his master’s baggage, and
to put it safely ashore.</p>

<p>This he was at length enabled to effect with the aid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
David Muir and the mate; after which the articles destined
for Mooshanne were piled in readiness for the waggon which
was to convey them, and the remainder found their way by
degrees to their respective destinations.</p>

<p>When at last the good&ndash;humoured valet found himself comfortably
seated in the merchant’s parlour with the worthy man
himself, Dame Christie, Jessie, and the mate, for his audience,
and a bottle of madeira, with some fried ham and fresh eggs
upon the table, he gave a sigh, the importance of which was
lost upon none of those present, and he looked from one to the
other with the conscious superiority of a man who knows how
much he has to tell.</p>

<p>It is not our province to follow him through the “hair&ndash;breadth
‘scapes,” the “moving accidents by flood and field,”
with which he set his astonished hearers “all agape;” the only
portion of his narrative which it concerns us to know, is that
which referred to the movements of Reginald Brandon and the
remainder of his party, who might, according to Monsieur
Perrot’s account, be almost daily expected at Mooshanne, as
they had left St. Louis and crossed its ferry with tent, baggage,
and a large cavalcade, on the day of his embarkation in the
great “Batteau.”</p>

<p>It was so long since Monsieur Perrot had tasted any liquid
with a flavour like that of the merchant’s madeira, that he
sipped and talked, talked and sipped, without noting the
lapse of time, and the evening was already far advanced before
he thought of rising to take his departure for Mooshanne;
even then, David Muir pressed him so strongly to remain
with him over&ndash;night, and continue his journey on the following
morning, that Monsieur Perrot found himself quite unable
to resist accepting the invitation; especially as he thought that
another day or two might probably elapse before the return of
Reginald; and, moreover, the bright eyes of Jessie Muir looked
a thousand times brighter from the contrast that her beauty
afforded to the swart dusky complexions by which he had so
lately been surrounded.</p>

<p>Leaving the merry Frenchman, and his still wondering
auditors in David’s parlour, we will proceed without delay to
Mooshanne, where it happened that, about four o’clock on the
same afternoon, a single horseman sprang from the animal
that, to judge from its appearance, had carried him far and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
fast, and, having rung the door&ndash;bell, waited not for any one to
answer it, but walked straight into the vestibule.</p>

<p>The bell was still ringing when the door of the drawing&ndash;room
was slightly opened that the blue eyes of Lucy might
herself reconnoitre the new comer; the next moment saw her
in her brother’s arms.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear Reginald! ’tis he, ’tis he, indeed!” and she
drew him into the room that her father might share her rapturous
joy.</p>

<p>While the colonel pressed his son to his heart in a fond
paternal embrace, Lucy ran up stairs to prepare the more
delicate nerves of her invalid mother for the shock of happiness
that awaited her.</p>

<p>Scarcely were these first affectionate greetings exchanged,
ere Lucy inquired with expectant eagerness, “When will they
arrive?—how far off are they, Reginald?”</p>

<p>“They cannot now be long; I think within a couple of
hours they must be here. If I mistake not, Lucy, there is
one of the party who begrudged me not a little my office of
<i>avant&ndash;courier</i>.”</p>

<p>Lucy blushed “celestial rosy red, love’s proper hue,” as
she felt how her heart leaped within her to meet the one to
whom her brother referred; and she hastened away to conceal
her mingled confusion and happiness, in the thousand little
details of preparation for her expected guests.</p>

<p>It may be as well here to mention, that immediately on
reaching St. Louis, Reginald had dispatched a messenger on
horseback to his father with a letter, containing the outline of
the events connected with his western expedition, and informing
him of the rescue of Prairie&ndash;bird, and of the attachment
that existed between her and himself. He spoke not of her
parentage, further than to say, that she had been carried off in
childhood from her own family, who were of a lineage and
descent altogether unexceptionable; and he entreated and conjured
his father not to entertain, nor pronounce any objection
to his proposed alliance, until he had an opportunity of seeing,
hearing, and judging for himself.</p>

<p>Reginald had also insisted upon Ethelston’s abstaining from
this topic in any letter that he might wish to send from St.
Louis, and the colonel had thought it advisable to say nothing
to Lucy of her brother’s attachment, while there remained a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
doubt of its being such as he could approve or sanction; so
that he had only informed her that the party would bring back
with them Prairie&ndash;bird, whom the young Delaware had mentioned
so often as his sister, but who was, in fact, the daughter
of English parents, of the highest respectability; and that she
would be accompanied by Paul Müller, a missionary, whose
reputation for piety and learning was extensively spread, and
who had been, since her residence with the Indians, her instructor
and adopted father.</p>

<p>Lucy’s curiosity to see Prairie&ndash;bird had been, since the
arrival of her brother’s letter, extraordinarily excited. Sometimes
she fancied her a half&ndash;wild, half&ndash;civilized being, clad in
a dress of skins, and speaking broken English. Then again
she was puzzled at the remembrance of the affectionate reverence,
almost amounting to worship, with which Wingenund
had spoken of her, and again her calculation was at fault.
Under these doubts and perplexities, she consulted Aunt Mary,
and with her aid and concurrence had prepared for her expected
guest a room upon the ground&ndash;floor, that looked upon her own
flower&ndash;garden. Its furniture was simple, but exceedingly
pretty, being a kind of representation of a tent, of an octagon
shape, and hung with a delicate&ndash;coloured pink chintz.</p>

<p>The view from the windows was lovely; for although the
flowery parterres had lost their brightest summer hues, a few
roses still lingered among them, contrasting with the thousand
autumnal colours that decked the shady mass of distant forests
between which and the flower&ndash;garden was seen here and there,
through a leafy vista, the winding course of the Muskingum.
Lucy had decked the interior of the room with all those nameless
comforts and luxuries that betoken women’s affectionate
care; several shelves were covered with well&ndash;selected books,
and two china baskets upon the table were filled with such
flowers as the indefatigable Aunt Mary had placed there, unconscious
for whom she gathered them.</p>

<p>As soon as Reginald had enjoyed a short interview with his
mother, whose health, though still delicate, had somewhat improved
since he had last seen her, Lucy entered, and taking
him by the arm, said, “Come, Reginald, you must inspect my
preparations. See, this is your own room, which you will find
rather more gay than when you left it, as Aunt Mary would
have it new&ndash;papered. That beyond is destined, as before, for
Ed—for Ethelston.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has Aunt Mary thought it requisite to new&ndash;paper that
too, or did it occur to Miss Lucy without her aunt’s suggestion?”</p>

<p>Lucy punished him with a slight pinch on the arm; and
then leading him down the stairs to the tent apartment, said
to him, “Now, Sir, I will show you what I have prepared
for your Indian lady; this is Prairie&ndash;bird’s room.”</p>

<p>The tell&ndash;tale blood rushed into Reginald’s bronzed and sunburnt
cheek, as he stood within the room destined to contain
his heart’s treasure; thoughts, far too sweet, and deep, and
swift for words, mingled the past and the future in a delicious
dream, as bending over his sister he kissed her fair forehead,
and pressed her in silence to his heart.</p>

<p>With the intuitive quickness of sympathy, Lucy read in that
expressive silence the secret of her brother’s breast; and looking
up to him, half&ndash;reproachfully, she said, “Reginald, could
not you have trusted your Lucy so far, as to tell her that
Prairie&ndash;bird would have a dearer title to her affections than
that of being Wingenund’s sister, or the child of the missionary’s
adoption?”</p>

<p>“Dear Lucy,” replied her brother, with an impressive earnestness,
that re&ndash;assured while it awed her, “there has been
so much of the mysterious and merciful working of Providence
in the history of Prairie&ndash;bird, that I am sure you will forgive
me when I ask you to wait a few hours before all is explained
to you. Meanwhile, receive her, for these few hours, as a
guest; if at the end of them you do not love her as a sister,
my prophetic spirit errs widely of its mark.”</p>

<p>Lucy saw well how deeply her brother’s feelings were moved,
and she prayed inwardly that her expected guest might fulfil
his prophecy. It must be owned, however, that there lurked
a doubt in her heart whether it could be possible that a girl,
reared in an Indian camp, could be to her a sister, or could be
worthy of that brother, whom her fond partiality clothed with
attributes beyond those which belong to ordinary mortals. Her
affection for Reginald would not permit her to let him perceive
these doubts; but fearful of betraying them by her manner,
she left him in the room destined for Prairie&ndash;bird, while she
hastened to aid the indefatigable Aunt Mary in some of the
other preparations that were going forward; the colonel
having given orders that the whole party, of whatever rank
or station, should be hospitably entertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span></p>

<p>Reginald was no sooner left alone, than casting his eyes
around the room, a sudden idea occurred to him of preparing
an agreeable surprise for his betrothed on her entrance to her
new domicile. He remembered having seen below, in the
drawing&ndash;room, a Spanish guitar, which he lost no time in securing;
and having taken it from the case, he ascertained that
it was a very fine instrument, and that the strings were in very
tolerable order. He now laid it upon the sofa&ndash;table in her
room, placing beside it a slip of paper which he took from his
pocket, and which seemed from its soiled and crumpled condition,
to have suffered not a little from the various wettings to
which, during the past months of travel, it had been exposed.
Still he lingered in the room, noting with satisfaction the
various trifling luxuries and comforts which his sister had prepared
for Prairie&ndash;bird, when suddenly he caught the sound of
a bugle&ndash;note, in which he instantly recognised the signal to be
given by Baptiste of the party’s approach.</p>

<p>How did his heart beat within him as he flew to welcome
them! yet were its throbbing pulsations like the quiet of sleep
compared to those of the maiden, who now drew near the
home of her infancy. Ethelston had leaped to the ground,
and half supported her in the saddle with one hand, while with
the other he checked Nekimi, whose impatient neigh betrayed
his remembrance of the corn&ndash;bin, and the well&ndash;known stall.</p>

<p>“Edward—Edward, I cannot go through this!” said the
half&ndash;fainting girl. “My thoughts are all confused—my
brain turns round—see there is the house! I cannot remember
it. O, stay a minute—only one minute, that I may
recover myself!”</p>

<p>“Dear Evy!” said her brother, looking up while she
leaned affectionately upon his shoulder, “’tis natural that
your thoughts should be mingled and confused, but let them
not be gloomy <i>now</i>! The house is so changed within the last
ten years, that had you built it yourself you could not recognise
it in its present state. Already I can distinguish dear
Aunt Mary’s white cap and apron; and Lucy, longing to embrace
a sister; the gray locks of the stately colonel, and one
beside him, who will not be the last to welcome Prairie&ndash;bird!”</p>

<p>“I can distinguish nothing, Edward; there is a mist
before my eyes: but it is a mist of love and happiness unspeakable!”</p>

<p>“Courage, dear Evy!” said her brother in a cheering tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
“let them not think that Prairie&ndash;bird draws near with slow,
unwilling step, and that her heart regrets the change from the
prairie to the scenes of her childhood, and the home of her
choice!”</p>

<p>“Edward!” said his sister reproachfully, while a tear started
in her eye, and the blood mounted to her temples; then,
shaking back the dark locks from her glowing cheeks, as if
she would thereby shake off the temporary weakness by which
she had been overcome, she added, “Remount your horse;
we have yet some hundred feet to go; if Prairie&ndash;bird draws
near with slow, unwilling step, it shall be Nekimi’s fault, and
not her own!”</p>

<p>So saying, she shook the loosened rein upon the neck of
the fiery steed, which, bounding forward with a spring that
would have unseated a less practised rider, bore her swiftly to
the door, where he stopped, obedient to her delicate hand, and
champed, and frothed, and snorted, as if proud alike of his
burden, and of his own matchless symmetry of form.</p>

<p>Never had her radiant beauty so thrilled through Reginald’s
every nerve as at this moment, when, lightly touching his
proferred arm, she sprang to the ground; her cheek glowing
with agitation, and her eye moistened by contending emotions,
she interchanged with him one silent look of conscious love,
and then turned, with gentle grace, to receive the greeting of
Colonel Brandon.</p>

<p>We have before said that he had been far from pleased
with the contemplated alliance of his son, and had made up
his mind to receive Prairie&ndash;bird with cold and studied courtesy,
nor to treat her otherwise than as an ordinary guest, until he
should have satisfied himself respecting her birth and connexions;
but, in spite of himself, these resolutions vanished
before the irresistible attractions of her manner and bearing,
so that, instead of only extending his hand, as he had proposed,
he imprinted a parental kiss upon her forehead, saying,</p>

<p>“Welcome, heartily and truly welcome to Mooshanne!”</p>

<p>She tried to speak, but she looked on the half&ndash;remembered
features of Reginald’s father, and her collected strength began
to fail. At this moment she was greeted by Lucy, whom she
already knew to be the chosen of her brother’s heart.</p>

<p>“Prairie&ndash;bird must learn to love her sister!” whispered
she, folding her in an affectionate embrace.</p>

<p>“<i>Learn</i>, Lucy!” replied Prairie&ndash;bird, whose tears could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
no longer be controlled; “Learn! can a few years have so
changed our faces and our hearts, that Lucy and Evy must
now learn to love each other?”</p>

<p>Before the astonished girl could reply, Aunt Mary, darting
forward with frantic haste, exclaimed, “What voice is that?”
then catching Prairie&ndash;bird by the arm, examined with wild
intensity every line of her countenance. As she looked, the
tears gathered in her own eyes, her frame trembled with
agitation, and she fell upon her neck, saying, “’Tis she—’tis
my poor brother’s long&ndash;lost child!”</p>

<p>Lucy’s heart told her that it was so indeed: Colonel Brandon
was overcome with astonishment; but he read in the
looks of Reginald and Ethelston that the lost treasure was
restored; and as memory retraced in the features of Prairie&ndash;bird
those of his attached and lamented friend, he too was
unmanned; and grasping Ethelston’s hand, wrung it with an
emotion beyond the power of words.</p>

<p>The news spread like wildfire throughout the house, that
Captain Ethelston’s sister was returned; and Lucy was obliged
to run with all speed to her mother’s room to prevent a sudden
shock of joy that might affect her weakly nerves. Is it possible
to describe or imagine the transports of the succeeding
hour in that happy circle! or the caresses showered upon
Prairie&ndash;bird! What word would the pen or tongue employ?
“Congratulations?” As well might one attempt to represent
Niagara by the water poured from a pitcher!</p>

<p>We will trust that hour to the reader’s heart, and will suppose
it past, and that Lucy, with still tearful eyes, and her
arm still round her recovered sister’s neck, was leading her
from the room where she had just knelt, to receive Mrs.
Brandon’s maternal kiss, when in passing a half&ndash;open door,
Lucy said, “Evy, that is your brother’s room; but he is not
in it, he is still on the lawn.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I must look into Edward’s room,” exclaimed Prairie&ndash;bird;
and opening the door, she entered, followed by Lucy.
A rifle, a fowling&ndash;piece, and a fishing&ndash;rod stood in one corner;
over them were ranged several pairs of pistols, and two or three
cutlasses, apparently of foreign workmanship; in the opposite
corner, near the window, was a globe, by the side of which stood
a case filled with naval charts; on the other side of the room
was ranged a row of shelves well stored with books, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
writing&ndash;table in the centre was covered with papers, all neatly
tied and docketed, as he had left them at his last departure.</p>

<p>Prairie&ndash;bird’s eye wandered with a certain degree of interest
over all these indications of her brother’s habits, until it rested
upon a small portrait, hung over the chimney&ndash;piece. It represented
a man of middle age and stature, and although the
painting was scarcely above mediocrity as a work of art, the
expression of the countenance was strikingly open and benevolent.
Prairie&ndash;bird gazed upon it, until she thought that the
mild orbs upon the inanimate canvass returned her affectionate
gaze. With clasped hands and beating heart, she stood awhile
silent, and then sinking on her knees, without removing her
eyes from the object upon which they rested, she murmured,
in a whisper scarcely audible, “My father!”</p>

<p>It was indeed the portrait of his lamented friend, that
Colonel Brandon had kindly placed in Ethelston’s room, a circumstance
which had escaped Lucy’s memory at the moment
of her entering it.</p>

<p>Stooping over her kneeling companion, she kissed her forehead,
saying, “Evy, I will leave you for a few minutes to
commune with the memory of the honoured dead; you will
find me in the vestibule below.” So saying, she gently closed
the door, and left the room.</p>

<p>In less than a quarter of an hour Prairie&ndash;bird rejoined her
friend; and though the traces of recent emotion were still to be
observed, she had recovered her composure, and her countenance
wore an expression of grateful happiness.</p>

<p>“Come, Evy,” said her young hostess, “I must now show
you your own room; the cage is not half pretty enough for so
sweet a bird, but it opens upon the flower&ndash;garden; so you can
escape when you will, and your dear good Paul Müller is your
next neighbour.”</p>

<p>An exclamation of delight broke from the lips of Prairie&ndash;bird
as she entered and looked around the tented apartment,
and all its little comforts, prepared by Lucy’s taste and affection.
Fortunately, the day was beautiful, and the casement&ndash;windows
being wide open, her eye caught, beyond the flower&ndash;garden, a
view of the distant mass of forest, with its thousand varied
autumnal tints, reposing in the golden light of the declining sun.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is too, too beautiful!” said Prairie&ndash;bird, throwing
her arms around Lucy’s neck; “I can scarcely believe that
this is not all a dream!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span></p>

<p>“There have indeed been some fairies here, or some such
beings as dwell in dreams, Evy,” said Lucy, whose eyes fell
upon the guitar lying on the table; “for I left this room a
short time ago, and this instrument was not here then. Who
can have brought it?—can you play upon it, Evy?”</p>

<p>“A little,” replied Prairie&ndash;bird, colouring.</p>

<p>“And see,” continued Lucy, “here is a scrap of paper
beside it, so soiled and dirty that I should have put it in the
fire had I seen it before; do you know the hand&ndash;writing,
Evy?” As Lucy said this, she looked archly up in her
friend’s face, now glowing with a rosy blush. “Well, you
need not answer, for methinks I know it myself; may I
unfold the paper, and read its contents? What, no answer
yet? then I must take your silence for consent.” Thus
saying, she opened the paper, while Prairie&ndash;bird, blushing
still more deeply, glanced at it with longing, but half&ndash;averted
eyes. “Verses, I declare!” exclaimed Lucy. “Why, Evy,
what magic art have you employed to transform my Nimrod
brother, the wild huntsman of the west, the tamer of horses,
and the slayer of deer, into a poet?”</p>

<p>She then proceeded to read, in a voice of deep feeling, the
following stanzas, which, although without any pretensions to
poetical merit in themselves, found such acceptance with their
present warm&ndash;hearted and partial judges, that, at the conclusion
of their perusal, the two girls fell upon each other’s neck, and
remained locked in a silent and affectionate embrace.</p>

Tuesday Night.</i>—R. B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On the following day, the family party at Mooshanne were
assembled at luncheon under a large tree on the banks of the
Muskingum, from beneath the shade of which the gables and
irregular chimneys of the house were seen through occasional
openings in Lucy’s shrubbery; while the deep river flowed
silently onward, bearing away in its tranquil course the leafy
tribute of autumn showered upon it by the light breath of the
western wind.</p>

<p>Already had Prairie&ndash;bird visited the spot where her father’s
house had stood, the site of which was only to be recognised
by a few heaps of stones and blackened timbers, over which
the luxuriant mosses and lichens with which that region abounds
had long since cast their mantle of green, while a few apple,
plum, and peach trees, unprotected by hedge or fence still
showed “where once the garden smiled.”</p>

<p>Colonel Brandon had not thought it advisable to rebuild
either the house or the offices after their destruction by the
savages, but had contented himself with a careful administration
of his late friend’s property, leaving it to his son Edward
to choose a site for his residence at a later period. Neither
must it be supposed that our heroine had omitted to pay a
morning visit to Nekimi, who now knew her voice and obeyed
her call like an affectionate and faithful dog. As soon as she
came to the stable, into which he had been turned without
halter or fastening of any kind, the generous animal, after saluting
her with a neigh of recognition, rubbed his broad forehead
against her shoulder, and playfully nibbled the grains off
the head of maize which she held out to him; but even that
he did not venture to do until he had acquired a claim to it by
holding one of his feet up and pawing with it until she let it
rest in her delicate hand. It must assuredly have been by mere
accident that Reginald entered while she was thus employed,
and reminded her how he had, with prescient hope, foretold
this very scene amongst the rocky cliffs of the far distant
Andes. Well did Prairie&ndash;bird remember the spot, and every
syllable of that prophecy; neither did she affect to have forgotten
it, but with a sweet blush held out one hand to her lover,
while the other still played with the silken tresses of Nekimi’s
mane.</p>

<p>What a delightful occupation is it to caress a dumb favourite
by the side of one beloved, when the words of endearing tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
lavished on the unconscious pet are the outpourings of
a heart sensitively shrinking from addressing them directly to
their real object! And if it be true, that many a sleek and
glossy spaniel has thus received the caress intended for its
owner, how much more natural was it that Reginald and
Prairie&ndash;bird should find pleasure in bestowing their caresses on
a noble animal, endeared to them by so many associations; for
while she remembered how often Nekimi had borne him in the
chase and in the fight, he was not likely to forget with how
true and unwearied a step the faithful steed had carried his
betrothed over many hundred miles of mountain and of prairie;
and even now, as her hand rested in his, both by a conscious
sympathy thought of Nekimi’s former generous lord, and
breathed a sigh over War&ndash;Eagle’s untimely fate.</p>

<p>To return to our party assembled round the luncheon&ndash;table
under the venerable tree. The first tumult of joy had subsided,
and was succeeded by a feeling of more assured happiness—“a
sober certainty of waking bliss,” which pervaded every
breast. Aunt Mary contemplated her lovely niece with looks
of the fondest affection, recalling in her sweet smile and in the
expression of her features the beloved brother, whose loss she
had with deep but chastened grief for many years deplored;
for a few minutes there was a general silence; one of those
pauses in which each member of the party pondered, as if by
a common sympathy, on the wonderful events which had led
to their reunion. Lucy was the first to break it.</p>

<p>“Reginald,” said she, “you related to us yester&ndash;evening the
commencement of your homeward journey, and how the Delaware
called ‘Stony&ndash;heart’ was permitted by the Osages to
return unhurt to your camp: you must resume the thread of
your tale where you left it, and tell us especially how and
where you parted from dear Wingenund, to whom we all owe
a debt of gratitude greater than we can ever pay.”</p>

<p>“That do we indeed, Lucy,” replied her brother, earnestly;
“fortunate, too, is, it that deeds of generous self&ndash;devotion like
those done by Wingenund reward themselves, and that a debt
of gratitude to one whom we love is a treasure, not a load
upon the breast. You remember how a writer, who used to be
a favourite with you, has expressed it:</p>

<p class="pph12 p1">‘A grateful mind</p>
<p class="pph6">By owing owes not, but still pays, at once<br />
Indebted and discharged.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“What a beautiful thought!” exclaimed Prairie&ndash;bird,
eagerly; “tell me the book wherein I may find it written.
Such a lovely flower as that cannot surely grow alone; there
must be others of similar beauty near it.”</p>

<p>“There are, indeed; fresh, fragrant, and abundant, as on
a western prairie in June; ‘Paradise Lost’ is the garden
wherein they grow; many of the descriptions contained in it
are among the most beautiful in our language; I hope ere long
to read them to and with you, dearest,” he added in a whisper,
intended for her ear alone: “there are some lines descriptive
of Eve as she first appeared to Adam, which always seemed to
me exaggerated, until you taught my eye to see and my heart
to feel their truth.”</p>

<p>With a deep blush Prairie&ndash;bird cast her dark eyes upon the
ground, while Reginald continued aloud, again addressing
himself to Lucy.</p>

<p>“Our own adventures after we crossed the Platte river are
scarcely worth relating; for although we had a few alarms
from wandering parties of Pawnees, Omahaws, and Dahcotahs,
our band was too strong and too well armed to fear anything
from their open attack; and the ever&ndash;watchful care and
sagacity of Wingenund left them no chance of surprising us.</p>

<p>“The warlike spirit and experience of his noble brother
seemed to have descended, like Elijah’s mantle, upon the
youth; and feeling the responsibility that attached to him as
leader of the party, he allowed himself little rest either by day
or by night, setting the watches himself, and visiting them
repeatedly at intervals to ascertain that they were on the alert.
He always came to our camp&ndash;fire in the evening, and I observed
that he daily became more interested in the conversation of our
worthy friend the missionary, and more anxious to understand
the principles and truths of Christianity; in so doing he was
not only following the bent of his own amiable and gentle disposition,
but he felt a secret pleasure in the remembrance that
he was fulfilling the last wishes of his dying brother. I dare
say Paul Müller would now tell you that he would be thankful
indeed if the average of professing Christians understood
and practised the precepts of their creed as faithfully as Wingenund.”</p>

<p>“That would I in truth, my son,” replied the missionary;
“nevertheless I cannot claim the honour of having been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
instrument of the conversion of the Delaware youth or his
brother; it was effected, under the blessing of Heaven, by the
patient, zealous, and affectionate exertion of Prairie&ndash;bird.”</p>

<p>“Nay, my dear father, you do yourself grievous wrong in
so speaking,” said Prairie&ndash;bird, reproachfully; “and even were
it as you say, to whom do I owe every thing that I know?
whom have I to thank that I was not left in the dark and
hapless condition of the females by whom I have so long been
surrounded?”</p>

<p>The tears gathered in her eyes as she spoke, and she
pressed affectionately to her lips the hand which her adopted
father extended to her.</p>

<p>“Yes, my sister speaks only the truth,” said Ethelston,
addressing the missionary in a voice of deep emotion; “we all
feel how far beyond the power of words we are indebted to you
for all that you have done for her, and we only trust that some
opportunity may be afforded us of showing a deep, sincere,
and permanent gratitude that we are unable to express.”</p>

<p>Colonel Brandon, and every one of the family circle rose, as
by a common impulse, and one by one confirmed by a silent
pressure of the hand, the sentiment expressed by Ethelston.
The venerable man, uncovering his head, and allowing the
breeze to waive to and fro his silver locks, looked for a minute
upon the kindred group before him, and thus addressed
them:—</p>

<p>“Think you not, my friends, that this scene, these happy
faces, and this happy home, might well reward any degree or
duration of earthly toil? But toil there has been none, for
the teaching and nurture of this sweet child has been from the
first a labour of love; and the only pain or regret that she has
ever caused me, is that which I now feel, when I recollect,
that I must resign her into the hands of her natural guardians,
and return to my appointed task, the occasional troubles of
which will not any more be sweetened by her presence, nor its
vexations be soothed by her affection. Such, however, is the
will of Him whom I serve, and far be it from me to repine.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” interrupted Reginald, eagerly, “you will not leave
us yet. After the fatigues and trials of this summer, you will
surely give yourself some repose.”</p>

<p>“My son, I would gladly dwell awhile in this pleasant and
happy abode; but I must not leave Wingenund to contend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
unaided against the difficulties by which his present path will
be beset, the doubts and temptations which may assail him
from within, and the sneers or scorn he may experience from
the more proud and violent spirits of his tribe.”</p>

<p>“There is, however, one service that you have promised
to render before you take your departure from Mooshanne.
Perhaps there are others here beside myself who will urge
you to its faithful performance.”</p>

<p>This bold speech threw the whole party into momentary
confusion. Prairie&ndash;bird, pretending to whisper to the missionary,
hid her blushing face upon his shoulder; the conscious
eyes of Ethelston and Lucy met; while Aunt Mary
bestowed upon Colonel Brandon one of those knowing smiles
with which elderly ladies usually think fit to accompany
matrimonial allusions.</p>

<p>The awkwardness was of short duration; for the mutual
feelings of the parties betrothed were no secret to any present;
and Reginald was not of a disposition to endure unnecessary
delays; so he drew Prairie&ndash;bird with gentle force towards her
brother, and still retaining her hand in his own, he said,
“Ethelston, will you, as guardian of your sister, consent to my
retaining this fair hand? Beware how you reply, lest I should
use my influence against you in a request which you may
make to my father.”</p>

<p>Had Ethelston been ignorant of his sister’s feelings, he
might have read them in the expression of her blushing countenance;
but being already in full possession of them, and
meeting a smile of approval from Colonel Brandon, he placed
his sister’s hand within that of Reginald, saying, “Take her,
Reginald, and be to her, as a husband, true, faithful, and affectionate,
as you have been to me as a friend.”</p>

<p>It will not be supposed that Ethelston waited long for the
consent of either her father or brother to his union with Lucy;
and Paul Müller agreed to remain at Mooshanne one week, at
the end of which time the double ceremony was to take place.</p>

<p>While these interesting arrangements were in progress, the
noise of wheels, and the tramp of many horses, announced the
approach of a large party; upon which Colonel Brandon, accompanied
by the missionary and Aunt Mary, went to see
who the new comers might be, leaving the two young couples
to follow at their leisure. The Colonel was not long kept in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
suspense as to the quality of his visitors, for before reaching
the house, he heard the broad accent of David Muir’s voice
addressing Reginald’s attendant.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, thank ye, Maister Parrot,” for so did he pronounce
the Frenchman’s name; “if ye’ll just haud the uncanny
beast by the head, Jessie can step on the wheel an’ be down
in a crack. There, I tauld ye so; it’s a’ right noo; and Jessie,
lass, ye need na’ look sae frighted, for your new gown’s nae
rumpled, an’ Hairy will tak’ the bit parcel into the house
for ye.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, father, I am not frightened,” said Jessie, settling
the side curls under her bonnet upon her glowing cheek, and
giving the parcel to Henry Gregson, whose hands had for the
moment encircled her waist as she jumped from the wheel to
the ground. Several vehicles of various descriptions followed,
containing the spoils and baggage brought back from the
prairies, together with Pierre, Bearskin, and all the members
of the party who had accompanied Reginald and Ethelston,
and who now came to offer their congratulation on the events
attending their safe return; for the story of the wonderful restoration
of Ethelston’s sister to her family had already spread
throughout the neighbourhood, receiving, as it went, various
additions and embellishments from the lovers of the marvellous.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jessie Muir had gathered from Monsieur Perrot
sufficient information respecting the true state of affairs, to set
her mind at rest with respect to Reginald Brandon’s intentions;
and encouraged by the interest which the Colonel and
Lucy had always taken in her prospects, she felt a secret assurance
that they would prove powerful auxiliaries in advocating
the cause of Harry Gregson, and reconciling her parents to his
suit. Neither was she mistaken in her calculation; for while
the preparation for the entertainment of the numerous guests
was going forward, Colonel Brandon, after a brief consultation
with Ethelston, called David Muir aside, and opened to him
the subject of the youth’s attachment to his daughter.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say whether the surprise or the wrath of the
merchant were the greater on hearing this intelligence, which
was not only a death&ndash;blow to his own ambitious hopes, but
was, in his estimation, an act of unpardonable presumption on
the part of young Gregson.</p>

<p>“Colonel, ye’re surely no in airnest! it’s no possible!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
Jessie, come here, ye hizzie!” said he, stamping with anger,
and raising his voice to a louder pitch.</p>

<p>It happened that Jessie, being engaged in conversation with
Monsieur Perrot, did not hear his call, and the Colonel took
the opportunity of leading him a little further from the house,
and entreating his calm attention to the explanations which he
had to give. David walked on in silence, his face still red
with anger, and his heart secretly trembling within him when
he thought of his next interview with Dame Christie.</p>

<p>The Colonel, who knew both the weak and the good points
of his companion’s character, dexterously availing himself of
both, effected in a few minutes a considerable change in his
views and feelings on the subject. He represented to him that
Ethelston would now have a house and establishment of his
own; that his property was already very considerable, and,
with prudent management, would receive gradual augmentation;
and that from his attachment to Gregson, it was his
intention to make the honest mate’s son the managing agent of
his concerns; to facilitate which purpose he, Colonel Brandon,
proposed to advance a few thousand dollars, and to establish
the young man in a suitable house in Marietta.</p>

<p>“David,” continued the Colonel, “you and I have long
been acquainted; and I do not think you ever yet knew me to
give you counsel likely to injure your welfare or your prospects,
and you may trust me that I would not willingly do so
now. The young people are attached to each other; they may
certainly be separated by force; but their hearts are already
united. Harry is an honest, industrious, enterprising lad; he
will start in the world with fair prospects; every year will lend
him experience; and as you and I are both of us on the wrong
side of fifty, we may be very glad a few summers hence to
rest from active business, and to have about us those to whom
we can entrust our affairs with well&ndash;placed confidence.”</p>

<p>There was much in this speech that tended to soothe, as
well as to convince, the merchant. He was gratified by the
familiar and friendly expressions employed by the Colonel,
while his shrewd understanding took in at a rapid glance the
prospective advantages that might accrue to the agent managing
the extensive affairs of the families of Brandon and Ethelston;
added to this, he was at heart a fond and affectionate
father; and the symptoms of irritation began to disappear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
from his countenance; yet he scarcely knew how to reply,
and before even he meant to speak, the name of his gude&ndash;wife
escaped from his lips.</p>

<p>“Leave me to manage Dame Christie,” said the Colonel,
smiling. “Ethelston shall go into Marietta himself, and break
the subject to her, founding his request upon his regard for
the elder Gregson, who has served under him so faithfully
ever since his boyhood. Come, my good friend, let us join
the party: I do not press you for any reply now; but if you
should detect a stolen glance of affection between the young
people, do not be angry with Jessie, but think of the day when
you first went forth, dressed in your best, to win a smile from
Dame Christie.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Colonel, ye’re speakin’ of auld lang syne now!” said
the merchant, whose ill&ndash;humour was no longer proof against
the friendly suggestions of his patron, though he muttered to
himself, in an under&ndash;tone, as they returned towards the house,
“I ken now why Maister Hairy was aye sae fond o’ the store,
when the ither lads were fain to win’ awa to hunt in the woods,
or to fish in the river! Weel a weel, he’s a douce callant,
an’ the lassie might aiblins gae farther an’ fair waur!”</p>

<p>The preparations for the entertainment were still in progress,
under the superintendence of Aunt Mary and Monsieur
Perrot; the latter having already doffed his travelling attire,
and assumed, in his jacket of snowy white, the command of
the kitchen, when Harry Gregson, who had opened the Marietta
post&ndash;bag, put a letter into the hands of Reginald
Brandon, which he instantly knew, by the bold, careless
hand&ndash;writing, to be from his uncle Marmaduke. He broke
the seal, and read as follows:—</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">“Shirley Hall, July 15.</p>

<p class="pbqh">“Dear Reginald,</p>

<p class="pbq">“I have very lately received your letter, announcing your
intention of making a hunting excursion in the west, in pursuit
of bears, elk, wolves, Indians, and other wild beasts. I
hope you’ll come safe back, with a score or two of their outlandish
brushes. After you left me, I began to feel very uncomfortable,
and did not know what was the matter, for I was
cold by night, and sulky and out of sorts by day. Parson
Williams took me in hand; but though we drank many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
bottle of old port together, and played drafts, and attended
several road&ndash;meetings (which you know was an amusement I
had never tried before), it was all no use, and I began to think
that I was on a down&ndash;hill road to the next world; but, somehow
or other, it happened that I dropped in now and then to
the parsonage, and whenever I had talked half an hour with
Margaret (you remember Margaret, the parson’s daughter),
I felt in a better humour with myself and all the world. So
matters went on, until one day I mustered courage to ask her
to come up to the hall, and change her name to Shirley. She
did so, and your old uncle writes with the halter round his
neck. When I married, Perkins came down from London
(the son of my father’s solicitor) with a dozen boxes of parchment,
in a post&ndash;chaise; and made me sign my name at least
a score of times; after which I desired him to draw up two
more deeds for my pleasure. These were for transferring
to yourself, and to your sister, a legacy left me a few years
ago by an old relation whom I had never seen, and whose
money I did not want. The amount is forty thousand pounds;
so there will be twenty thousand pounds apiece for you, and
you may set to work and clear (as you used to call it) an estate
as big as the old county of Warwick. I explained what I was
about to Meg, telling her, at the same time, that it was a
debt that I owed you in conscience, having considered you for
so many years as my heir, until her plaguing black eyes made
a fool of me, and threatened me with the prospect of brats of
my own. For this she pulled my ears twice; first for calling
her Meg instead of Greta, by which name she was known at
the parsonage; and secondly, for talking about the brats, a subject
which always makes her cheeks redden. But I had no idea
of putting the reins into her hand so early in the day, and I
told her outright, that the first boy should be called Reginald,
to please me; and the second might be called Greto, to please
her; and the third might be called Marmaduke to please the
family: on which, without waiting to hear any more, she
bolted, and left me master of the field. I have just mentioned
this, in order that you, if ever you get into a similar scrape,
may know how to behave yourself. Mr. Perkins has completed
his deeds of assignment, and has received my instructions
to transfer the money to America by the next vessel, in
bills upon Messrs. Powell and Co., of Philadelphia; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
though I have more than once found you as proud and as
straight&ndash;laced as a turkey&ndash;cock where money was concerned, I
know that you dare not, you dog!—I say you dare not refuse,
either for yourself or your sister, this token of the
affectionate regard of your uncle,</p>

<p class="pbqr">“<span class="smcap">Marmaduke Shirley</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">The flush that came over Reginald’s open countenance as
he read this epistle from his eccentric but warm&ndash;hearted relative,
did not escape the watchful eye of Lucy, who was standing
near him, and she anxiously inquired whether it contained
any unpleasant intelligence.</p>

<p>“Read it, Lucy, and judge for yourself,” he replied, while
he went to communicate its contents to Colonel Brandon.</p>

<p>We will leave to the reader’s imagination the mirth and
festivity that reigned at Mooshanne during that happy evening;
how Pierre, Baptiste, and Bearskin talked over their
adventures of ancient and of recent date; how David Muir’s
grey eye twinkled when he detected Jessie exchanging a stolen
glance with Harry Gregson; how the cheers rang through
the forest when the Colonel proposed the health of Prairie&ndash;bird,
the long&ndash;lost child of his dearest friend, the bride of his only
son; and how Aunt Mary’s sweetmeats and preserves adorned
her snowy table&ndash;cloth; and how Monsieur Perrot had contrived,
as if by magic, to load the hospitable board with every
swimming, flying, and running eatable creature to be found in
the neighbourhood, dressed in every known variety of form.
The healths of Ethelston and Colonel Brandon had not been
forgotten; and the latter, observing a shade of melancholy
upon his son’s brow, said to him aloud, “Reginald, you have
not yet given your friends a toast, they claim it of you now.”</p>

<p>Thus addressed, Reginald, reading in the dark eyes of his
betrothed, feelings kindred to his own, said in a voice of deep
and undisguised emotion, “My friends, you will not blame
me if I interrupt for a moment the current of your mirth, but
it would be doing equal injustice, I am sure, to your feelings
and to my own, were we to part without a tribute to the memory
of one, now no more, to whose self&ndash;devoted heroism
Ethelston owes the life of a sister, and I the dearest treasure I
possess on earth: The memory of my Indian brother, War&ndash;Eagle,
late Chief of the Delawares!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span></p>

<p>The party rose in silence, every head was uncovered, a tear
trembled on the long lashes of Prairie&ndash;bird’s downcast eye,
and Baptiste muttered to himself, yet loud enough to be heard
by all present, as he reversed his glass, “Here’s to the memory
of the boldest hand, the fleetest foot, and the truest
heart among the sons of the Lenapé!”</p>

<p>As the day was now drawing to a close, David Muir returned
to Marietta, Ethelston having promised to pay a visit
to Dame Christie on the following day. The merchant was
so elated by the day’s festivities, that he winked his grey
twinkling eye at Jessie, forgetting at the moment that she
knew nothing of the conversation that had passed between the
Colonel and himself; and when the youth, in escorting them
homeward, warned David of sundry holes and stumps upon
the road, thereby enabling them to avoid them, he poked his
elbow into Jessie’s side, saying, “He’s a canny lad, yon Hairy
Gregson; what think ye, Jessie?”</p>

<p>She thought that her father was crazy, but she said nothing;
and a certain vague sensation of hope came over her, that all
was going more smoothly for her wishes than she had dared
to expect.</p>

<p>For the ensuing week the whole village of Marietta was
enlivened by the preparations for the twofold wedding at
Mooshanne; silks, ribbons, and trinkets without end were
bought, and there was not a settlement within fifty miles in
which the miraculous return of Reginald Brandon’s bride was
not the theme of discourse and wonder. Paul Müller became
in a few days so universally beloved at Mooshanne, that all the
members of the family shared in the regret with which Prairie&ndash;bird
contemplated his approaching departure; and as they
became more intimately acquainted with him, and drew from
him the various information with which his mind was stored,
they no longer marvelled at the education that he had found
means, even in the wilderness, to bestow upon his adopted
child. Colonel Brandon was extremely desirous to make him
some present in token of the gratitude which he, in common
with all his family, felt towards the worthy missionary, and
spoke more than once with Reginald on the subject: but the
latter stopped him, saying, “My dear father, leave us to
manage that, we have entered into a secret conspiracy, and
must entreat you not to forbid our carrying it into execution.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span></p>

<p>The colonel smiled, and promised obedience, knowing that
those in whose hands the matter rested were more familiar
with the good man’s wants and wishes than he could be himself.</p>

<p>At length the week, long as it may have appeared to Reginald
and Ethelston, passed away. The morning which united
them to those whom they had respectively loved through so
many trials and dangers, arrived; and Paul Müller, having
joined the hand of his beloved pupil to the chosen of her
heart, prepared to take his leave, when she knelt to him for
his blessing. With faltering voice and tearful eyes he gave
it; she could not speak, but pointing to a small box that
stood upon an adjoining table, with a letter addressed to him
beside it, yielded to the gentle force with which her bridegroom
drew her from the room.</p>

<p>Taking up the letter, the missionary read as follows:—</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“Oh, my beloved preceptor and father, let me once again
thank you for all your goodness and affectionate care! for to
you, next to my Father in heaven, do I owe all my present
happiness, and all my knowledge of that Saviour who is my
everlasting hope and trust. My heart would sink under the
thought of being separated from you, if I did not know that
you are returning to my dear young brother Wingenund, to
guide and assist him in the good path that he has chosen; tell
him again and again how dearly we all love him, and that day
after day, and night after night, he shall be remembered in
his sister’s prayers.</p>

<p>“I am sure you will not forsake him, but will give him
your advice in teaching his Lenapé brothers, who have laid
aside the tomahawk, to cultivate the earth, and to raise corn
and other nourishing food for their little ones. You will also
continue your favourite and blessed work of spreading among
them, and the surrounding tribes, the light of the gospel.
Edward and Reginald tell me that for these objects nearest
your heart, gold and silver can be usefully applied, and they
desire me to entreat your acceptance of this box containing a
thousand dollars, one half to be expended as you may think
best for spreading Christianity among our Indian brethren,
and the other half in seeds, working&ndash;tools, and other things
necessary for Wingenund and those who dwell with him.</p>

<p>“I hope you will come and see us at least once in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>

you can bring him with you, the sight of him will make glad
our eyes and hearts.</p>

<p>“Farewell, dear father. Forgive the faults in this letter,
remembering that although I have read so much to you and
with you, I have had little practice in writing, and neither
Reginald nor Edward will alter or correct one word for me;
they both smile and say it will do very well; perhaps it may,
for, without it, you know already how dearly you are loved

<h2 class="p2">SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER.</h2>


<p>Supposing the gentle reader to have taken sufficient interest
in Prairie&ndash;bird to be desirous of learning something of the
after fortunes of herself and those connected with her, we
subjoin a letter which accidentally came into our possession,
and which appears to have been written a few years subsequent
to the date of the conclusion of the preceding tale.</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">“St. Louis, June 12th, 18—.</p>

<p class="pbqh">“Dear Ethelston,</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>“I have just returned from my long&ndash;promised visit to
Wingenund, whose village is situated, as you know, not far
from the southern banks of the Missouri, about one hundred
miles beyond St. Charles’s. I found there our respected and
venerable friend Paul Müller, whose intercourse with Wingenund
and his band has been for some years almost uninterrupted,
and productive of the most striking improvement, both
in the village itself, and in the character and manners of its
inhabitants. Several small settlements of Delawares are in
the neighbourhood, all of whom acknowledge Wingenund as
their chief; and most of them have availed themselves, more
or less, of the teaching of the exemplary missionary.</p>

<p>“The village is situated on the side of a hill, gently sloping
to the south, along the base of which flows a considerable
stream, which, after watering the valley below, falls into the
Missouri at a distance of a few miles. The huts or cottages
occupied by the Delawares are built chiefly of wood; and each
having a garden attached to it, they present a very neat and
comfortable appearance. That of Wingenund is larger than
the rest, having on one side a compartment reserved entirely
for the use of the missionary; and on the other a large oblong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
room, in which are held their devotional meetings; the
latter serves also the purpose of a school&ndash;room for the education
of the children. You would be surprised at the progress
made by them, and by many of the adults, in reading, as well
as in agriculture and other useful craft; and I must own
that, when my eye fell upon their ploughs, hammers, saws,
chisels, and other utensils, and then rested on the Bibles, a
copy of which is in every dwelling, I felt a deep and gratifying
conviction, that our annual present to Wingenund has
been productive of blessings quite beyond our most sanguine
expectations.</p>

<p>“I need scarcely tell you that his reception of me was that
of a man welcoming a long&ndash;absent brother. He fell on my
neck, and held me for some time embraced without speaking;
and when he inquired about his dear sister Olitipa, his voice
resumed the soft and almost feminine tones that I formerly
noticed in it, when he was under the influence of strong emotion.
In outward appearance he is much changed since you
last saw him, having grown both in breadth and height; indeed,
I am not sure whether he is not now almost as fine a
specimen of his race as was his noble brother, whom I never
can mention or think of without a sigh of affectionate regret.
Yet, in his ordinary bearing, it is evident that Wingenund,
from his peaceful habits and avocations, has lost something of
that free and fearless air that distinguished his warrior brother.
I have learnt, however, from Baptiste (who, as you know,
insisted upon accompanying me on this expedition), that the
fire of former days is subdued, not extinguished within him,
as you will perceive from the following anecdote, picked up by
our friend the guide from some of his old acquaintance in the
village.</p>

<p>“It appears that last autumn a band of Indians, who had
given up their lands somewhere near the head waters of the
Illinois river, and were moving westward for a wider range
and better hunting&ndash;ground, passed through this district; and
seeing the peaceful habits and occupations of the Delawares
settled hereabouts, thought that they might be injured and
plundered with impunity. They accordingly came one night
to a small settlement only a few miles from here, and carried
off a few score of horses and cattle, burning at the same time
the dwelling of one of the Delawares, and killing a young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
who attempted to defend his father’s property. A messenger
having brought this intelligence to Wingenund, he collected a
score of his most trusty followers, and taking care that they
were well armed, went upon the trail of the marauders. He
soon came up with them; and their numbers being more than
double his own, they haughtily refused all parley and redress,
telling him, that if he did not withdraw his band they would
destroy it, as they had destroyed the young Delaware and his
house on the preceding night.</p>

<p>“This insolent speech, uttered by the leader of the party,
a powerful and athletic Indian, aroused the indignation of
Wingenund; his eyes flashed fire, and his followers saw that
the warrior spirit of his early days was rekindled within him.
Ordering them to unsling and level their rifles, but not to fire
until he gave the word, he drew near to the leader of the
party, and in a stern voice desired him to restore the plunder
and give up the murderer of the Delaware youth. The reply
was a shout of defiance; and a blow levelled at his head, which
he parried with his rifle, and, with a heavy stroke from its
butt, levelled his antagonist on the ground; then, swift as a
panther’s spring, he leaped upon the fallen Indian’s chest, and
held a dagger to his throat.</p>

<p>“Panic&ndash;struck by the discomfiture of their leader, and by
the resolute and determined attitude of the Delawares, the
marauders entreated that his life might be spared, promising
to give all the redress required; and on the same day Wingenund
returned to his village, bringing with him the recovered
horses and cattle, and the Indian charged with the murder,
whom he would not allow to be punished according to the
Delaware notions of retributive justice, but sent him to be
tried at a circuit court then sitting near St. Charles’s. This
exploit has completely established our young friend’s authority
among his people, some of whom were, if the truth must be
told, rather disposed to despise the peaceful occupations that
he encouraged, and even to hint that his intercourse with the
missionary had quenched all manly spirit within him. You
will be surprised to hear that he has married Lita, who was
for a long while so deeply attached to his brother: even had
she been the wife of the latter, this would have been as conformable
to Indian as to ancient Jewish usage. She now
speaks English intelligibly, and asked me a thousand questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
about Prairie&ndash;bird. Fortunately, she had chosen a subject of
which I could never weary; and I willingly replied to all her
inquiries: when I told her that her former mistress and
favourite had now three little ones, the eldest of whom was
able to run about from morning till night, and the youngest
named Wingenund, after her husband, tears of joy and of
awakened remembrance started in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I understood her silent emotion, and loved her for it.
How changed is her countenance from the expression it wore
when I first saw it! Then it was at one moment wild and
sad, like that of a captive pining for freedom; at the next,
dark and piercing, like that of the daughter of some haughty
chief. Now you may read upon her face the gentle feelings
of the placid and contented wife.</p>

<p>“When I left the village, Wingenund accompanied me for
many miles; twice he stopped to take leave of me, when
some still unsatisfied inquiry respecting your Lucy or Prairie&ndash;bird
rose to his lips, and again he moved on. I can scarcely
remember that he uttered any distinct profession of his affection
for any of us, and yet I saw that his heart was full; and
what a heart it is, dear Edward; fear, and falsehood, and self,
are all alike strangers there! When at length we parted, he
pressed me in silence against his breast, wrung the hand of
Baptiste, and turned away with so rapid a stride, that one who
knew him not would have thought we had parted in anger.</p>

<p>“On reaching the summit of a hill whence I could command
a few of the track that I had followed, I unslung my
telescope, and carefully surveying the prairie to the westward,
I could distinguish, at a distance of several miles, Wingenund
seated under a stunted oak with his face buried in his hands,
and in an attitude of deep dejection. I could scarcely repress
a rising tear, for that youth has inherited all the affection that
I felt for him to whom I owe my Evelyn’s life!</p>

<p>“Harry Gregson and his wife are very comfortably settled
here, and appear to be thriving in their worldly concerns. I
have been several times to his counting&ndash;house, and, from the
returns which he showed me, your investments in the fur&ndash;trade,
as well as in land, seemed to have been most successful.</p>

<p>“Jessie’s looks are not quite so youthful as they were when
she was the belle of Marietta, but she has the beauty of unfailing
good&ndash;temper, which we Benedicts prize at a rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
unknown to bachelors. Harry has promised to pay us a visit
this autumn; he will be delighted with the new house that
you have built for his father, since his promotion to the rank
of captain.</p>

<p>“Perrot has found so many ‘compatriots’ here, that he
chatters from morning till night; and his wonderful adventures,
by ‘flood and field,’ both in Europe and the Western
Prairies, have rendered him at once the lion and the oracle of
the tavern at which we lodge.</p>

<p>“Distribute for me, with impartial justice, a thousand loves
among the dear ones in our family circle, and tell Evy that I
shall not write again, as I propose to follow my letter in the
course of a few days.</p></div>

The name of Tamenund is doubtless familiar to all Americans who have taken
the slightest interest in the history of the Indian tribes, as well as to that more
numerous class who have read the graphic and picturesque descriptions penned
by the great American novelist: nevertheless, it may be necessary, for the information
of some European readers, to state that Tamenund was an ancient
Lenapé chief, whose traditionary fame is so great in the tribe, that they have
from time to time given his name to chiefs, and even to white men whom they
desired especially to honour. At the time of the revolutionary war, so numerous
were the traditions and legends respecting this hero, that he was in some
quarters established as the patron saint of America, under the name of St.
Tammany; and hence arose the Tammany societies and Tammany buildings in
various parts of the Union.—See Heckewalder’s <i>Historical Account of the Indian
Nations</i>, chap. xl., and <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, vol. iii. p. 152, &amp;c.</p>

In describing the manners and distinctions of rank among the Indians of the
Missouri plains, it is necessary to adopt the terms in common use among the guides
and traders, however vague and unsatisfactory those terms may be. In these
tribes the chieftainship is partly hereditary and partly elective: there is usually
one Great Chief, and there are also chiefs of a second degree, who are chiefs of
different bands in the tribe; next to these in rank are the “Braves,” the leading
warriors of the nation; and in order to be qualified for admission into this rank,
an Indian must have killed an enemy or given other sufficient evidence of courage
and capacity. When a war&ndash;council it held, the opinion of the principal <i>Brave</i> is
frequently preferred before that of the chief.</p>

“Medicine&ndash;men.” This term (commonly used by traders among the Indians
beyond the Mississippi) signifies the “priests,” or “mystery&ndash;men,” who are set
apart for the celebration of all religious rites and ceremonies. They are the same
class as those who were described by Charlevoix, and other early French writers,
as “Jongleurs,” because they unite medical practice to their sacerdotal office, and,
more especially in the former, exercise all manner of absurd mummery. Their
dress, character, and habits vary according to the tribe to which they belong; but
they are genuine “Jongleurs” throughout.</p>

Every warrior belonging to the Lenapé, Saukee, and all the branches of the
great Chippewyan tribe, believes himself to be under the mysterious guardianship
of some spirit, usually represented under the form of an animal. This is called his
“totem,” and is held sacred by him: thus, a warrior whose totem is a tortoise, or
a wolf, or even a snake, will cautiously abstain from injuring or killing one of those
animals.</p>

An allusion to the fondness of bears for honey occurs more than once in this
tale, and will be met with in some shape or other in most works which treat of that
animal’s habits and propensities: that such is the case in Europe, as well as in
North America, may be gathered from the fact that, in the Russian tongue, a bear
is called “Med&ndash;vede,” which word is thus formed: <i>med</i>, honey; <i>vede</i>, who knows:
“He who knows honey.”</p>

The buffalo robes worn by the Osages, as well as by some other Missouri
tribes, are variously ornamented and painted with devices. Some of these refer to
war, some to marriage, some to medicine or mystery; these last are generally worn
at councils, on which occasions a chief who has some important subject to propose,
frequently adds to the paint on his face some streaks corresponding to the devices
on his buffalo robe.</p>

In the performance of the war&ndash;dance among the Indians of the Missouri, the
tread of the dancers is guided by a monotonous chaunt, sung by some of the Medicine&ndash;men,
and accompanied by the beat of a small drum of the rudest construction,

stretched upon a wooden frame hollowed out with a knife by the squaws.</p>

Mahéga here alludes to that unfortunate era in the history of the Lenapé, so pathetically
described by Heckelwader, when they permitted themselves to be persuaded
by the whites to abandon all their warlike weapons and pursuits, and following
those of agriculture, to leave the affairs of war entirely to the northern tribes,
who guaranteed their safety. The consequence was such as might have been expected,
they were treated with contumely and injustice; and being compelled at length
to resume those arms to which they had been for sometime unaccustomed, they suffered
repeated defeats and disasters from the “six nations,” and adjoining tribes.</p>

the latter had adopted his new friend, not only as a brother, but as a member of

The country of the Stone&ndash;eaters, or, as they are called in their own language,
the Assineboins. This is a branch of the Great Sioux tribe to the northward of
the Missouri river; the region is peculiarly wild and broken, and the Indians inhabiting
it are famous for their pedestrian activity and endurance.</p>

Pommes de prairie are small roots, somewhat resembling white radishes, that
are found in great abundance in the Western wilderness, being in some places the
only esculent vegetable within a range of several hundred miles: when eaten raw
they are tough, tasteless, and hard of digestion; but if boiled or stewed, are tolerably
palatable and wholesome.</p>

The Indians believe that some persons have the power of injuring, or even of
killing others at a distance of many hundred miles, by charms and spells: this belief
in witchcraft is constantly noticed by Tanner and others, who have resided
long among the Indians, and it seems to have been especially prevalent among the
Oggibeways and other northern tribes. In illustration of a similar notion in the
eastern hemisphere, see Borrow’s “Zincali, or the Gypsies of Spain,” vol. i. chap.
ix. on the Evil Eye.</p>

One of the most extraordinary specimens of the ingenuity of the tribes who
inhabit the Great Missouri wilderness, and who speak many languages, so different
that they can have with each other no verbal communication, is the language of
Signs, common to them all, by which Pawnees, Dahcotahs, Osages, Black&ndash;feet,
Upsarokas, or the Crows and other Western nations, can understand each other
quite sufficiently for the ordinary purposes of their simple life. The sign for “all
right” is made by holding the hand with the palm downwards, in a horizontal
position, and waving it slowly outwards.</p>

This exclamation resembles the English word “How&ndash;how,” repeated with a
strong aspirate and great rapidity. It seems common to all Indian nations, for the

then dwelling near the banks of the Mississippi.</p>

Aricará. This tribe is by descent a branch of the great Pawnee nation, to

It has before been mentioned, that among the roving tribes of the Great Missourian
wilderness every one has its distinctive national sign: these are well
known to each other, and to white men who are experienced in the life of the
Far&ndash;west: the sign mentioned in the text is that adopted by the Upsarokas, as
they intend, by the motion of their extended arms, to imitate the wings of a crow in
flight. The Sioux, Black&ndash;feet, Pawnees, Snakes, Aricarás, Comanches, &amp;c., have
all their distinctive national signs; but an enumeration of them would be tedious,

It is unnecessary to inform the reader that neither the date nor the description
of this solar eclipse is intended to challenge scientific criticism. Merely the general
features are preserved of that kind of solar eclipse which is termed “annular,” and
which takes place when the eclipse, though central, is not total, on account of the
moon not being near enough to hide the whole of the sun, in which case part of
the latter is seen as a bright ring round the part hidden by the moon.</p>

down in the same direction as that in which they are going. A party travelling
along it from the opposite quarter, are said to take the back&ndash;foot of the trail. The

aware whether it is in common use; at all events it explains its own meaning significantly

The herbs mingled by the Indians with a small proportion of tobacco, are frequently
of a light and fragrant flavour; sometimes, too, they have some narcotic
properties. In order fully to enjoy their qualities after the Indian fashion, the
smoker must inhale the smoke by the mouth and expel it through the nostril, in
which operation the nerves and small vessels of the latter experience a pungent
sensation, which some consider highly agreeable, and is not unlike that which is
caused by a pinch of mild or perfumed snuff.</p>

Among some of the North American tribes it is the custom for an Indian entering
into a solemn obligation, to place his hand against the thigh of the party to
whom he makes the promise; and this usage has in several instances been triumphantly
quoted by those authors who have laboured to prove the descent of the
North&ndash;American Indians from the lost tribes of Israel: the origin and meaning of
the custom, which is as ancient as the time of Abraham (Gen. xxiv. 2), are both
involved in great obscurity: sundry explanations have been attempted by learned
commentators of different ages and nations; the Jewish writings of the highest
authority, such as the Targum of Jerusalem, and that of Jonathan Ben Uzziel, derive
it from the covenant of Circumcision, to which they maintain its symbolic analogy
by arguments which it is unnecessary here to produce. Adam Clarke, in his Commentary,
leans to this view, but does not offer any conclusive reasoning in support
of it. Bishop Patrick, following the learned Calmet, describes this usage as an
ancient sign of subjection and homage prevalent throughout the East; and Locke
mentions it as being “practised by some Indians to this day.”</p>

The various methods of counting adopted by the western tribes are curious in
the extreme; some reckon chiefly by fives, and among these an expression equivalent
to “hands and feet” signifies “twenty;” in one language the number
eight is expressed by a word meaning six with two; in another by a word signifying
ten without two: in fact, some very interesting illustrations of their language
and modes of thought might be drawn from an accurate investigation of their numerals,
but they would be entirely out of place in a work of fiction.</p>

It has before been mentioned that the division and notation of time vary extremely
in the Indian tribes; those who have had much commerce with the whites
have coined words answering to what we denominate hours; but the tribes of the
Far&ndash;western prairies usually express the successive periods of the night by resting
the cheek upon the hand in a recumbent posture, and then, holding up the forefinger
and thumb in the form of a crescent, they show, by the number of motions
which they make in pointing to the sky, the number of hours or watches after

To some who have read the descriptions of bear&ndash;hunts in Norway and Russia
it may appear neither wonderful nor unusual that a single hunter should kill a
full&ndash;grown bear; but it must be borne in mind, that the bear of the north of Europe
bears about the same proportion to a grisly bear of the Rocky Mountains
(<i>Ursus horribilis</i>) as a panther does to a Bengal tiger. The grisly bear is not
only the largest and most ferocious of his species, but his tenacity of life is so remarkable
that he frequently runs a considerable distance and survives some hours
after receiving several balls through the lungs, head, and heart. On this account
it is never safe for the most experienced marksman to attack him alone, unless
there be some tree or place of safety at hand, for the grisly bear cannot or will not
climb a tree; and some idea of the animal’s strength may be formed from the fact,
attested by many credible witnesses, that, after killing a bison, he will frequently
drag the carcase some distance to his lair. For descriptions and anecdotes of the
grisly bear, see Lewis’s and Clark’s Expedition to the Rocky Mountains, and Major
Long’s ditto. A feat almost similar to that recorded in the text was performed
some years ago by an Iroquois, one of the last of his tribe, and who, though grievously
wounded, survived. The Author saw this Indian hero arrive at St. Louis in
a canoe, containing only himself and a boy, they having descended the Missouri for
more than 1500 miles in their frail bark; and having passed in their perilous
voyage the villages of Crows, Riccarees, Sioux, Black&ndash;feet, and other predatory
tribes.</p>

Of all the Indian nations who inhabit the wild regions near the base of the
Rocky&ndash;Mountain range, the most fierce and powerful are the Black&ndash;feet. Few, if
any white men have penetrated into the heart of their country, and returned to tell
their tale. Very little is known, therefore, either of their customs or language:
and it may not be uninteresting for the reader to be informed, that every particular
mentioned respecting them in this volume, was obtained direct from a French
trader, who had been permitted to marry a Black&ndash;foot wife, and had resided nineteen
years among them. The construction of their language is very remarkable,
and some account of it would doubtless be gladly received by philologists; but
such a subject cannot be treated in a work like the present. With respect to the
words referred to in the text it will be seen that they show the synthetic nature of
the language, “nâma” being the root, and signifying a <i>weapon</i>. Hence came
“suksinâma,” <i>rifle</i>; literally, “heavy weapon;” “saksinâma,” <i>pistol</i>; literally,
“light&ndash;weapon;” “nahtovinâma,” <i>wonderful</i>, or <i>medicine&ndash;weapon</i>; and “nitsi&ndash;nâma,”
literally, <i>useless weapon</i>; which latter name has probably been given to
the bow, since the Black&ndash;feet have learnt the superior efficacy of fire&ndash;arms.</p>

It may not be generally known to European readers, that the arrows used by
the western Indians are of two sorts. The <i>hunting arrow</i>, which has a head tapering
in the form of an acute lozenge, and firmly secured to the shaft, so as to be
easily withdrawn from a wound, and the war&ndash;arrow, sometimes poisoned, but
always barbed like a fish&ndash;hook, and having its head so slightly fastened to the shaft,
as to remain infixed in the wound when the wood is pulled out.</p>

The name by which the Black&ndash;feet are generally known among the Crows is
“Echipeta.” In their own tongue they call themselves “Siksikaga;” both words
having the signification of Black&ndash;feet. They are divided into three bands, the
largest of which is called by the generic name above mentioned, as being that of
the tribe; the other two bands are called “Piecan” or “Piegan” (the meaning of
which word is not known to the author), and “Ka&ndash;in&ndash;na,” or “Bloody&ndash;men,”
which last are held to be the most fierce and formidable of the three.</p>

The Missouri is here alluded to, the ancient name of which, “Pekitanoui,”
signifies “muddy water” in the language of the Illinois, once a most powerful
tribe, dwelling near its confluence with the Mississippi. They have since given a
name to one of the states of the Union, but not one of the tribe survives at this day.
Some antiquarians think that they were formerly a branch of the great nation of
the Delawares (a supposition confirmed by the resemblance of their name, Il&ndash;lenni,
to that of the Lenni&ndash;Lenapé); one half of which remained on the great prairies
bordering the Mississippi, while the other half overran, and finally occupied, the
greater portion of country between the Ohio and the Atlantic.—See Charlevoix,

These, and many other particulars respecting the Six Nations, the author had
from the lips of a veteran, who was carried off as a child by the Senecas when they
sacked Wyoming. He was adopted into their tribe, and lived with them the
greater part of his life, during a portion of which he acted for them in the capacity
of interpreter and Indian agent; afterwards he retired to spend a vigorous and
green old age in the western part of the state of New York. He always spoke with
affectionate enthusiasm of his adopted kindred, and it was easy to see that the
white man’s blood in his veins circulated through an Indian heart. Those who
wish to know more of the early history of the Five Nations are referred to the accurate
and interesting account given of them by Colden.</p>

tribes. The subject is too comprehensive to be more than briefly alluded to in
